              <h1>#91. Brainspotting Part 2.</h1>
							<p>In this episode, we’re going to wrap up our review on the book “Brainspotting” by David Grand. We’re also going to talk about a change in podcast format.
              <p>A couple of things jumped out at me from the book. In chapter 12, the author talks about doing therapy with an actor and it helped me realize the cumulative stress of doing comedy for the last 10 years. I’m saying stress instead of trauma because it’s a bit more neutral of a word and I sound less like an action hero.
              <p>An example of stress is the last time I got up in front of a live audience. It was at an open mic and I was last on the lineup. I noticed an audience member had been wearing her jacket the whole time during the show so I joked with her about not being able to escape this three-hour open mic. It got a big laugh so I decided to cut my set short. As I leave the stage, the host walks past me and mutters under his breath, “two-pump chump” and it broke my heart a little bit. Sure, I don’t last long in bed but there’s no need to point it out.
              <p>Reading that chapter helped me make sense of my own experience. I was burned out but couldn’t pinpoint the reason so I felt like a quitter and a failure. That one insult wasn’t the reason I took a break from performing, but it was the thousand paper cuts over a decade. It’s the verbal abuse and being taken advantage of by comedy club owners and workshop teachers. It’s being bullied and having your jokes stolen by other comedians. It’s being unable to afford basic necessities like the latest iPhone.
              <p>The other thing from the book that I liked is the author acknowledges how complex the brain is and how unknowable it is. The therapist’s job isn’t to offer insight but to create a space for the client’s brain to heal itself. Personally, it means I don’t have to know everything about my own mind. Like why I keep dreaming about squirrels. Maybe I was a dog in my past life.
              <p>Which brings us to the new format. As you’ve noticed, I’m not doing a second voice which is probably a relief to some of you. Or maybe just me. Probably just me. Just me, myself, and I. 
              <p>I hope this was an act of love. Thank you for listening.
