              <h1>#43. The State Of Affairs.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today, we’re covering another book by Esther (pronounced Estaire) Perel called “The State Of Affairs.” Apologies for mispronouncing her name in the past episodes. 
<p>Voice Of Judgement: What?! You’re only now learning how to say her name?
<p>C: Yeah, sorry about that.
<p>VOJ: Are we going to spend forever on this book too?
<p>C: No, just this episode. We’re not going go into too much depth.
<p>VOJ: Yay, shallow understanding of things!
<p>C: So this book is about challenging the assumptions about infidelity.
<p>VOJ: Like which ones?
<p>C: Like what counts as infidelity, or that the relationship and the adulterer is at fault or that affairs are only destructive.
<p>VOJ: So what’s an affair?
<p>C: It’s hard to define. Is a lap dance cheating? What if you have a purely online relationship? How about watching porn? Perel suggests talking about this openly so that couples can define the boundaries of their relationship and continually evolve those boundaries.
<p>VOJ: Aren’t affairs what happens in unhappy marriages?
<p>C: Going back a bit to her other book, “Mating In Captivity”, Perel reiterates her point that our expectations of marriage are too high. They’re not meant to be an all encompassing means to happiness. A happy marriage can be stable and nurturing. But this leads itself to boring sex. It doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with the marriage or even the adulterer. It’s normal to crave the aliveness and excitement an affair can bring. 
<p>VOJ: Wait, it’s not the adulterer’s fault?
<p>C: Relationships are complex. And there are a lot of ways that partners let each other down, not with just cheating. Some one can be absent, neglectful, indifferent or contemptuous.  
<p>VOJ: And affairs aren’t always destructive?
<p>C: They definitely hurt. But they can also reinvigorate a marriage. Some relationships come out stronger for it. And even if the marriage is over, it can be reinvigorating for the divorcees. 
<p>VOJ: Like how?
<p>C: For example, Perel reached out to a former patient, Luke, to see how he was doing. Ten years before she had told him straightforwardly that his marriage was over. He didn’t take it well. He wanted to throw the coffee table at her and throw his wife, Anais, out the window. Anais had systematically rebuffed him in bed and then went on to have a two-year affair. Perel has talked to Anais individually and saw that the sexual gridlock was unlikely to change. Luke couldn’t see it because he was trapped in the idea of keeping the family together for his young daughter. Perel was helping him move on.  
<p>VOJ: Did he realize that later?
<p>C: Yeah, he does. I’m going to use the closing quote to finish the story.
<p>‘In retrospect, he tells me, “It was brutal, but you were right. I think
you knew that in my case, the best thing was to rip off the Band-Aid”…
<p>Luke also remembered that I assured him there’d be a future. “You
said I’d be banging babes aplenty and that I’d feel that electricity
because I’d be getting a ‘chargeback’ from someone who actually
wanted me as much as I wanted them. You were right. I even found
myself saying a silent and very sincere ‘thank you’ to Anais and her
boyfriend. And you know what? I used to have this excruciating back
pain. It stopped the day Anais moved out”…
<p>Anais may not have been the right romantic partner for Luke, but
he makes a point of saying that she’s been “a great partner to raise a
kid with.” They are friends. They go to their daughter’s soccer games
together, and often he buys her lunch afterward…
<p>“Have you forgiven her?” I ask him. “Yes,” he replies, “though at
first it seemed impossible.” He recalls how I told him that one day he
would understand that forgiving doesn’t mean giving the other a free
pass. It’s a gift one gives oneself. Sure enough, as time passed, he
got it. As Lewis B. Smedes writes, “To forgive is to set a prisoner free
and discover that the prisoner was you.”’
