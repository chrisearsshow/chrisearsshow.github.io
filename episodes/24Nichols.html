              <h1>#24. The Lost Art of Listening.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Hello, today, we'll be talking about the lost art of listening.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Where did you lose it?
<p>C: I didn't lose it.
<p>VOJ: Oh, so you found it.
<p>C: Actually, I did find it. The book caught my eye while I was browsing in a library.
<p>VOJ: And what does it say?
<p>C: The book is by Michael Nichols. It starts with explaining how many of us feel psychologically lonely because we aren't seen or understood. Listening is the remedy for that but unfortunately is rare. Hence it being a lost art.
<p>VOJ: So how do you listen?
<p>C: Nichols points out that  what most people think is listening is not talking and waiting for your turn to say something. Real listening is about taking in information and witnessing the other person's experience.
<p>VOJ: Sounds easy.
<p>C: It's not complicated but it's not easy to do. It's about suspending your judgments, agenda and beliefs. It's about existing for the other person. Forgetting our self and giving our attention. 
<p>VOJ: Now that sounds hard.
<p>C: Right? Think about how invasive your thoughts are when you're by yourself. 
<p>VOJ: Well, self arguing about our thoughts is kind of what makes this podcast work.
<p>C: True. Now imagine, we just listened to our self. Truly listened. Not judging or criticizing or berating.
<p>VOJ: Huh, that would be nice.
<p>C: Exactly. And yet we barely do it. If we can't do it for ourselves, we're not going to be great at it for others.
<p>VOJ: Why are we so bad at listening?
<p>C: For a couple of reasons. Technology has improved speed and frequency of communication but a lot also gets lost in quality. Like tone and humor. With so many things pulling our attention, being still and having the willpower to listen is rare. (Even when exercising a lot of people listen to music rather than listen to their own heartbeat and breathing.)
<p>VOJ: Man, that can't be great for relationships.
<p>C: Each time listening doesn't happen only adds stress to the relationship. That stress can build up to resentment. Which in turn makes it hard to listen, creating an unhealthy cycle. 
<p>VOJ: Huh, explains why sometimes it's easier to talk to strangers.
<p>C: Yes, and why our family members may drive us crazy but seem totally normal to non-family members.
<p>VOJ: So how do you break out of the cycle?
<p>C: By intentionally creating a quiet space. And getting comfortable with giving up control. 
<p>VOJ: What do you mean?
<p>C: Sometimes we're not great listeners because we're afraid of what we might hear. We have to appreciate and affirm what the other person is saying even if we don't like what they're saying.
<p>VOJ: Huh, that's hard to argue with. 
<p>C: Right? Okay, here's the closing quote.
<p>"Empathy is energizing. Being listened to releases us from brooding self-absorption and mobilizes us to engage the world around us."
