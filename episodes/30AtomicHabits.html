              <h1>#30. Atomic Habits.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today we're talking about a book by James Clear called  "Atomic Habits".
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Why atomic?
<p>C: The tendency is to focus on big actions when we want to make a change. James Clear suggests focusing instead on small, marginal changes. Because of the compounding effect, if you just get 1 percent better every day; after a year, you'll be thirty-seven times better. 
<p>VOJ: Wow! Did it work for him?
<p>C: Nope he just likes preaching.
<p>VOJ: Oh.
<p>C: Just kidding. It did work. When Clear was sixteen, he was playing baseball when a bat slipped out of his classmate's hand and hit him in between the eyes. It broke his nose, his skull and both eye sockets. His brain starting  swelling, leading to seziures. Clear was airlifted to a major hospital and then put in a medically induced coma and on a ventalitor.
<p>VOJ: Man, that's scary.
<p>C: Yeah. Thankfully he pulled through but it was long recovery. After surgery, he had double vision for weeks and it took a month before his left eyeball would stay in place.  Part of his rehab was just practicing how to walk in a straight line. It was eight months before the seizures would stop and he could drive again. His life was a mess and he lost a lot of confidence.
<p>VOJ: So he used atomic habits to get better?
<p>C: Nope. He just got a life coach.
<p>VOJ: Oh.
<p>C: Just kidding again. A couple of years after the accident, Clear went to university and that's where he used atomic habits to get his life together. Instead of partying, he kept an early bed time. Instead of the typical messy dorm room, he kept it clean and tidy. 
<p>VOJ: That sounds simple. 
<p>C: Yup and those little things added up. It gave him a sense of control of his life and he started to gain his confidence back. That first year he got straight A's. Clear then went on to be selected as the top male athlete at his university and was named to the ESPN Academic All-America Team (an honor only thirty-three players across the country get). When he graduated, he was awarded the university’s highest academic honor, the President’s Medal.
<p>VOJ: Yeah, but how did he look after getting his face smashed in.
<p>C: He looks fine.
<p>VOJ: Fine? Or Fiiiine.
<p>C: Uh, the first one? Listeners are probably now searching for him in Google images. 
<p>VOJ: That's okay. Search for "James Clear." We'll wait.
<p>C: I'm sure listeners know about the pause button.
<p>VOJ: Maybe we can do an ad if they're not pausing.
<p>C: We don't have any advertisers.
<p>VOJ: But first a message from our sponsors.
<p>C: What are you doing?
<p>VOJ: Do you sometimes feel tired and maybe out of breath?
Maybe you need oxygen.
10 out of 10 doctors recommend oxygen.
Get oxygen every day for a long, healthy, happy life.
Side effects include the ability to climb Everest or deep sea diving to see pretty fishes.
Visit your local window, for the latest version of oxygen.
Get it today. Breath comfortable. Breathe happy.
<p>C: Are you done?
<p>VOJ: Welcome back! So James Clear, he sounds super disciplined.
<p>C: To him, being disciplined is about structuring your life and environment so that it doesn't require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, spend less time in tempting situations.
<p>VOJ: So how do you make a new habit?
<p>C: By creating the four stages of a habit: cue, craving, response, and reward.
<p>VOJ: How do you do that?
<p>C: Let's say you want to start meditating and you already have a habit of showering in the morning. Use your shower as the cue to meditate right after. That's called habit stacking. You could also give yourself another cue by writing down an implentation intention. The more specific the better. For example, "I will meditate at 8am in my living room for two minutes after I shower."
<p>VOJ: How do you create a craving for it?
<p>C: Two ways. One is with temptation bundling. You combine the new habit with a habit that you already like or want. For example, if you have a favorite song, you could listen to it after meditating. Another way is to use peer pressure. Join a group where your new habit is the norm, like a meditation group.
<p>VOJ: Then what's the response part?
<p>C: This is about making the new habit easy. Here's where the two minute rule comes in. Just do any new habit for two minutes. That's it. It's not about going big or doing it perfectly. It's just about getting the rep in.
<p>VOJ: And the reward part?
<p>C: Here's where it gets a little tricky. Our brains aren't developed for delayed gratification. But healthy habits usually take a while to pay off. So to make it satisfying, you need to feel successful in some small way. And you do that by tracking the habit. Every time you finish meditating, mark an X in your calendar. Or give yourself a sticker. Then see how long you can go with out breaking the chain. 
<p>VOJ: What happens if you do miss a day?
<p>C: Then try again the next day. Try to never miss twice in a row. Tracking the habit should feel good. Feel proud of each rep that you get in. After a long enough streak, reward yourself.
<p>VOJ: Like with ice cream?!
<p>C: Exactly. With lots and lots of ice cream. Alright, here's the closing quote:
<p>“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.” 
<p>VOJ: Can we talk about he looks pretty okay for having his face smashed in?
<p>C: Hey, there's no need to be mean about it.
<p>VOJ: I'm just saying he's lucky. I was expecting Igor the hunchback.
<p>C: He got hit in the face, not run over by a car.
