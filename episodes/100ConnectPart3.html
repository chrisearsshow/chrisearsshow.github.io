              <h1>#100. Connect Part 3.</h1>
							 <p>Chris: Chapter 4 is about encouraging someone to open up.
<p>Other Voice: Mwahahaha, time to learn mind control.
<p>C: It’s more about letting go of control and meeting someone where they are. Which has several parts to it.
<p>OV: Oh man, you’re going to share a list now aren’t you?
<p>C: You know it! Here are four questions to help you meet someone where they are:
<ul>
<li>Are you speaking to what they want as opposed to what you want?
<li>Are you responding at the same emotional level?
<li>Are you seeing the world as they see it?
<li>Is this the best timing?
</ul>
<p>OV: I’m supposed to ask myself all that while talking to someone?
<p>C: A little bit. It’s more about being in a state of curiosity. Despite how perceptive you think you might be and how well you think you know another person, you may not know what’s going on for them.
<p>OV: So I’ll just ask them!
<p>C: Exactly. But a couple of cautions. Try to steer away from “why” questions. They tend to drive people into their heads and out of their feelings. And sometimes they sound like an implicit request that the other person justify themselves. The other thing to be careful of is asking leading questions. We don’t want to be offering advice disguised as questions. 
<p>OV: But I’m good at offering advice!
<p>C: You mean you like offering advice. You like showing off how smart you are and your analytical skills. But your advice is usually about what you would do rather than fully taking into account how the other best operates. Giving advice can also increase the power discrepancy between
two people. The person with an issue might feel one-down to start
with, and if the other person acts as though they have the answer,
that can exacerbate the gap.
<p>OV: But sometimes people ask me for my advice.
<p>C: Sure, people will do that but often what they want is a sympathetic ear. Either way, it wouldn’t hurt to be more curious and try to fully know what’s going on for the other person. Then you can take their style and approach into account.
<p>OV: Okay, be curious.
<p>C: Also keep in mind, empathy, and acceptance. By understanding and identifying with their emotions, that’ll also help the other person open up. 
<p>OV: Speaking of relationship advice, a mother was giving a warning to her young daughter, "When your boyfriend wants to kiss you, say the word "DON'T" and when he wants to hug you, tell him the word "STOP". The next day, the daughter came home super happy. So her mother asks, "Did you do what I told you to?" The daughter replies, "Yes! I used both words together, "DON’T STOP.”
<p>C: Stop giving advice! 
<p>OV: Do you know what some good advice is for going to the Andes Mountains?
<p>C: I don’t want to know.
<p>OV: Bring a jacket, it's pretty Chile.
<p>C: Sigh.
<p>OV: Final one, a man looking for medical advice, walks into a doctor's office. He has a cucumber up his nose, a carrot in his left ear, and a banana in his right ear. "Doctor, what's the matter with me?" he asks. The doctor replies, "You're not eating properly."
