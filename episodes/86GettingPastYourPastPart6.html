              <h1>#86. Getting Past Your Past Part 6.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 6 shares stories about trauma and how it relates to fear. Fear causes us to react disproportionately to situations and limits our choices.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: I have a phobia of speed bumps. But I’m slowly getting over it.
                <p>C: Phobias generally involve a fear of the fear. There’s a concern of being overwhelmed by the fear itself.
                <p>VOJ: I also have a huge phobia of hair. I dreadlocks.
                <p>C: Sometimes the treatment of phobias can become complicated
                because the fear is serving another purpose. That’s known as
                “secondary gain”—where the person is deriving some benefit from
                the fear.
                <p>VOJ: A man goes to a doctor for his phobia of getting married.
                The doctor asks, "Do you know about any of the symptoms?
                The man replies, "Can't say I do."
                <p>C: And to close, here’s a story from the author about processing fear:
                <p>Two of my colleagues have a beautiful son named
                Adam. When he was about three years old, he slipped and fell into
                the deep end of a swimming pool and started to sink. His father
                immediately dove in after him and handed him out to his mother at
                the edge of the pool. It was pretty frightening for everyone involved.
                But she used some of the techniques you’ve already learned and
                dealt with her fear so she could concentrate on Adam. She didn’t
                show how frightened she’d been. She didn’t try to laugh him out of
                his fear. She hugged Adam and kept saying to him, “It’s over. You’re
                safe now,” while leading him to take slow, deep breaths. They talked
                about the incident again and again that day; each time she
                reassured him and led him into the slow, deep breaths.
                <p>Then about six months later, when Adam’s mother was lifting him
                out of the bathtub, he looked her straight in the eye, threw his arms
                tightly around her neck, and said, “I’m safe now” and “I love you,
                Mommy.” He then asked her if she remembered pulling him out of
                the swimming pool and comforting him. Of course, she said that she
                definitely remembered the experience and was so happy that he
                knew that he was safe and protected and loved.
                <p>When Adam was six years old, his parents and I were visiting
                together and stopped at a playground. Adam went up into some
                tunnels and netting high above. After a while, we realized it was
                getting late and asked him to come down. He started to come, but
                moved very slowly and kept stopping. Not knowing what was going
                on, we called to him again, but he kept moving slowly and stopping.
                Suddenly we realized what was happening. A little girl, around four
                years old, whose mother was nowhere around, had managed to
                climb up to the netting and was afraid to come down. Adam kept
                urging her to follow him as he moved slowly along, stopping to allow
                her to catch up. He wouldn’t leave her. Finally, when they had made
                their way down to the ground, he looked her in the eye, patted her on
                the arm, and said, “It’s over, you’re safe now.” Then he was able to
                walk away as her mother came running up.
