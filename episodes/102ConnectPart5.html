							 <p>Chris: Chapter 6 is about pinches and crunches.
<p>Other Voice: Like when you get your skin caught in the door or when you want a six-pack.
<p>C: Or when the other person does something that bothers you. Like they make a joke at your expense.
<p>OV: But I can take a joke. I’m a good sport. Plus, complaining about it seems rude.
<p>C: Maybe. The concern is that pinches, which might be considered petty initially, can eventually fester to become a bigger problem. Then it’s a crunch. Usually, if you catch it early, then it’s less likely for the emotions to build up.
<p>OV: So we should raise an issue once we notice it?
<p>C: Right. Here’s where paying attention to your own emotions is important.
<p>OV: What if the other person didn’t mean anything by it?
<p>C: There’s a difference between the intent of one’s behavior and the impact of that same behavior. Most people, if they had the choice, would want to know if their behavior is causing a pinch for others, even if they didn’t mean any harm.
<p>OV: What if raising an issue makes it worse?
<p>C: It might. But waiting even longer will make it that much worse.
<p>OV: So how about crunches? How do you resolve them?
<p>C: The trouble with crunches is that feelings have built up so we’re likely to start developing a story about the other person. Then we start selectively collecting data to build our case and to support our view of that other person.
<p>OV: You still haven’t talked about how to resolve pinches or crunches.
<p>C: The next chapter will cover how to deliver feedback.
<p>OV: What?! 
<p>C: Okay, here are a few quick pointers:
<ul>
<li>Stay on your side of the net, which means not assuming what the other’s intentions are.
<li>Identify what you’re feeling, especially vulnerable emotions like hurt, rejection, and sadness.
<li>Convey your intention behind the feedback.
<li>Be specific in your feedback.
</ul>
<p>OV: Never mind. That’s too much to remember.
<p>C: That’s not even all of it.
<p>OV: Talking about misunderstanding someone else’s behavior, here’s a story:
<p>A police officer came upon a terrible wreck where the driver and passenger had been killed. As he looked upon the wreckage, a little monkey came out of the brush and hopped around the crashed car.
<p>The officer looked down at the monkey and said "I wish you could talk."
The monkey looked up at the officer and shook his head up and down.
<p>"You can understand what I'm saying?" asked the officer.
<p>Again, the monkey shook his head up and down. "Well, did you see this?"
<p>"Yes," motioned the monkey.
<p>"What happened?" The monkey pretended to have a can in his hand and turned it up by his mouth.
<p>"They were drinking?" asked the officer.
<p>"Yes."
<p>"What else?"
<p>The monkey pinched his fingers together and held them to his mouth.
<p>"They were smoking marijuana?"
<p>"Yes."
<p>"What else?"
<p>The monkey motioned "Screwing."
<p>"They were screwing, too?" asked the astounded officer.
<p>"Yes."
<p>"Now wait, you're saying your owners were drinking, smoking, and screwing before they wrecked."
<p>"Yes."
<p>"What were you doing during all this?"
<p>"Driving" motioned the monkey.
