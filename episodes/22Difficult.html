              <h1>#22. Difficult Conversations.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Hello! Today, we're talking about the book, "Difficult Conversations" by Bruce Patton, Douglas Stone, and Sheila Heen. 
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Man, that's a lot of authors. 
<p>C: It's actually appropriate since they break difficult conversations in to three parts.
<p>VOJ: Wait, they make difficult conversations in to more conversations?
<p>C: Yes and no. Yes, in that usually one difficult conversation doesn't solve the issue. But the upside is that difficult conversations are learning opportunities.
<p>VOJ: Uhhh, you sound like you're trying to trick me in to eating vegetables. 
<p>C: Okay, how about we get through this episode and we get ice cream?
<p>VOJ: I know what you're doing. I'm going to go along with it but I know what you're doing. Fine. What are the three parts?
<p>C: What happened, feelings and identities. 
<p>VOJ: What did happen?
<p>C: Here's where you talk about your different perspectives. In difficult conversations, we usually default to blaming. But if you instead focus on what happened, you can share your side of the story and intention.  Hopefully then you can hear the other people's perspectives. Usually both sides of the story contributed to the difficulty.
<p>VOJ: Don't good intentions pave the way to hell?
<p>C: That's intentions with out action. Which brings us to the assumption that  other people's intentions are negative. When usually, it's neutral or even positive. It's important to consider this reframe during the conversation. 
<p>VOJ: Ugh, this sounds like so much work.
<p>C: It is. But it would be so much more frustrating with out the framework. It helps to untangle the mess. Especially the part about feelings.
<p>VOJ: Feelings! I have feelings!
<p>C: Here's where emotional intelligence comes in.
<p>VOJ: Hey, we talked about this in the last episode!
<p>C: Exactly. In this part of the conversation, you have to be clear about your feelings with yourself. And then to express them. Not to blame but to communicate the impact of your feelings. 
<p>VOJ: Why?
<p>C: Because only then can the feelings evolve. Sort of like a release valve for the pressure build up.
<p>VOJ: And the last part?
<p>C: It's about identities. When we're challenged, we sometimes lose our ability to see ourselves as complex beings who make mistakes. We default to an all or nothing way of thinking that limits our options. Like I'm all good and they're all bad. The author's suggest using the "And Stance." I'm worthy of love AND I do bad things. They're a competent person AND they do dumb things.
<p>VOJ: I'm a sane person AND I love to talk to myself. 
<p>C: Right. After sharing and listening to those three parts, then hopefully everyone can come up with a solution that fits most people's needs.
<p>VOJ: I need ice cream!
<p>C: Okay, think about what flavor. A useful tool when sharing is to come up with a third story. Like the story from an impartial observer. This can help add some healthy detachment to the conversation.
<p>VOJ: Coconut! Do we have coconut?
<p>C: I'm sure we can find some. Here's the quote to close out the show.
<p>“People almost never change without first feeling understood.”
