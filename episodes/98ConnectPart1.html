              <h1>#98. Connect Part 1.</h1>
							 <p>Since my social circle is smaller than I would like, these next episodes will be about the book “Connect” by David Bradford and Carole Robin. It’s about building exceptional relationships with friends, family, and colleagues. 
              <p>Exceptional relationships have six characteristics:
              <ol>
              <li>You can be more fully yourself, and so can the other person.
              <li>Both of you are willing to be vulnerable.
              <li>You trust that self-disclosures will not be used against you.
              <li>You can be honest with each other.
              <li>You deal with conflict productively.
              <li>Both of you are committed to each other’s growth and development.
              </ol>
              <p>The first three center around self-disclosure. The last three have to do with feedback and conflict.
              <p>Part of the skill of building exceptional relationships is “Interpersonal Mindfulness.” It’s the ability to understand the other person while understanding yourself. By listening to both sides, you’ll find the best fit for your collective needs.
              <p>As you learn more about each other, your relationship deepens and trust builds. With that, you’re each increasingly willing to take risks about what you disclose, becoming even more vulnerable. As you become more important to each other, the relationship also becomes increasingly complex. Obligations and expectations build, as do potential points of contention. How will you deal with inevitable annoyances? If you can face and resolve them well, the relationship becomes even stronger.
              <p>If a major conflict comes up and you decide to avoid the issue altogether. The relationship may survive but it plateaus.
              <p>Then the chapter goes into an exercise of looking at your key relationships and evaluating them for the six characteristics. It also suggests that you pick one of the relationships and initiate a conversation about what you would like from that relationship. Next week, I’ll let you know how that goes. Dun, dun, dun, it’s a cliffhanger!
              <p>And here’s another therapy update. We spent most of the session talking about my background with isolation as a kid, bullying in school, and failed romantic relationships. We got to a place where my younger self was angry and didn’t find it fair. And surprisingly, my younger self recognized the unfairness of my parents' situation where they grew up during several wars and left their home country as refugees. It helped me understand why I approach situations with a survival mentality.
              <p>Alright, shifting gears, do you know why the mushroom has lots of friends? Because he's a fungi!
              <p>And do you know what to call your friends who love math? Algebros.
              <p>And finally, why did the owl invite his friends over? He didn't want to be owl by himself.
