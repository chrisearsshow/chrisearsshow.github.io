              <h1>#28. Mindset.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today's book is Mindset by Carol Dweck.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Mind ready?
<p>C: No. Mindset.
<p>VOJ: Mindgo! Catch me! I'm over here!
<p>C: What are you doing? We're doing a podcast!
<p>VOJ: Now I'm over here!
<p>C: Okay, I'll yell it to you. The book is about the difference between having a fixed mindset versus a growth mindset. The latter being the one that allows you to thrive in challenges. 
<p>VOJ: What's the difference?
<p>C: A fixed mindset is the belief that personality traits and success are set in stone. A growth mindset is the belief that qualities are changeable through effort. You'll probably have varying degrees of either mindset in different areas of your life.
<p>VOJ: Like what areas?
<p>C: Relationships, work, parenting, sports.
<p>VOJ: We're playing a sport right now!
<p>C: Yes, we are. In the sports chapter, Dweck tells us Billy Beane's story. He was a natural athlete. By the time Beane was a sophomore in high
school (around 16 years old), he was the highest scorer on the basketball team, the quarterback of the football team, and the best hitter on the baseball team. He went on to be a Major League Baseball first round pick.  
<p>VOJ: That sounds great.
<p>C: The problem was being seen as a natural led to a fixed mindset. He was so busy proving he was talented that he didn't analyze his deficiencies. The very idea of deficiencies terrified him. Beane was trapped and when failure came along, he couldn't handle it. 
<p>VOJ: What happened?
<p>C: His batting average got worse and worse and his career fizzled out. But before he stopped playing baseball he learned the importance of mindset from his teammate, Lenny Dykstra. He was half Beane's size and less physically talented. But Dystra had "no concept of failure." 
<p>VOJ: Like how? 
<p>C: Well, together they would watch the opposing pitcher warm up. Beane knew the pitcher had "heat", "the nastiest slider ever," and was "maybe the greatest left-hander in the history of the game." He told Dykstra all of this and Dystra sits there listening and after a moment, he replies “Shit, I’ll stick him.” He had total confidence. Dystra didn’t let his mind screw him up.
<p>VOJ: So did they win?
<p>C: Sort of. In their different ways. Dystra keeps playing baseball and goes on to be a three-time All-Star and wins a World Series championship. Beane, on the other hand becomes a scout and manager for the Oakland Athletics. and he doesn't forget the lesson about mindset.
<p>VOJ: How's that?
<p>C: The Oakland Athletics team gets sold to new owners and they decide to slash the team payroll, making it hard to get good players. Beane, along with another manager, Alderson, change their mindset on getting new players. Instead of following the tradition of batting averages, they use a new math called sabermetrics. 
<p>VOJ: Does it work?
<p>C: It does. The Oakland Athletics becomes one of the most cost-effective teams in baseball and in 2002, the Athletics became the first team in the 100+ years of American League baseball to win 20 consecutive games. Their story, along with Beane's, becomes the major Hollywood movie and bestselling book Moneyball. 
<p>VOJ: What?! We're talking about another book?!
<p>C: Yeah, it is a bit of a detour. Okay back to Mindset. 
<p>VOJ: Nooo! We didn't get to Brad Pitt!
<p>C: Okay, he plays Billy Beane in the movie and was nominated for an Academy Award. 
<p>VOJ: He's so dreamy. I would date him. 
<p>C: You and many others. Which nicely brings us to relationships. 
<p>VOJ: You can have a growth mindset with relationships?
<p>C: Yes, you can. The fixed mindset focuses on falling in love and natural romance. The belief is that relationships should be easy. That you can read each other's minds and agree on everything. 
<p>VOJ: That sounds pretty normal.
<p>C: Unfortunately though, when a relationship problem inevitably comes up, somebody gets the blame. It's seen as a character flaw. Which doesn't lend itself to change.
<p>VOJ: Huh, that would suck. 
<p>C: Yeah. And that's when friends and romantic partners become enemies. But with a growth mindset, you realize there are no problem free candidates and that relationships are about encouraging each other's development. 
<p>VOJ: That sounds much nicer. So how do you get that mindset?
<p>OC: ne way is to change how you talk to yourself. For example, instead of thinking “I can’t do this.” Think “I can’t do this YET.” Try to keep in mind that it’s not about immediate perfection. It’s about learning something over time and making progress.
<p>VOJ: I've made a lot of progress running around. Can we stop now?
<p>C: Sounds good. Here's the closing quote:
<p>“If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, and keep on learning. That way, their children don’t have to be slaves of praise. They will have a lifelong way to build and repair their own confidence.”
