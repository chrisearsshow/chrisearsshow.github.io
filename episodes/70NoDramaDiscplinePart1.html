              <h1>#70. No Drama Discipline Part 1.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: It’s a new book and a new day in this episode. The book is “No Drama Discipline”,  by Daniel Siegel and Tina Bryson.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: These guys again? We just did a book by them. Why are we reading parenting books! We don’t have children!
                <p>C: Like the last book, it’s an insight in to our own childhoods and could be a useful communication tool with adults. 
                <p>VOJ: How? You can’t discipline adults.
                <p>C: Depends on how you see discipline. The authors suggest less of a punishment approach and more of a teaching approach. 
                <p>VOJ: That sounds like something a parent would say while hitting you with a belt. “That’ll teach you!”
                <p>C: Which might get you short term obedience but won’t get you to the longer term goal.
                <p>VOJ: What’s that?
                <p>C: To raise a child with the skills and capacity to deal with challenging situations and frustrations. To know how to delay gratification, contain urges to react
                aggressively toward others, and flexibly deal with not getting their
                way.
                <p>VOJ: Yeah, hitting them might not be the way to go. How about time outs?
                <p>C: It’s still punishment. Time outs tend to leave children angrier, more dysregulated and in isolation. 
                <p>VOJ: So what do you do?  
                <p>C: Connect and redirect. It’s like the last book. Attune to their feelings first.
                <p>VOJ: How is that no drama? If the kid is acting like a crazy person, why would I want to attune to that?
                <p>C: Because it’s usually the quickest way to de-escalate the emotions. When the kid is misbehaving, it’s usually when they need connection the most.
                <p>VOJ: How does that help self regulation?
                <p>C: By interacting and connecting with you as the parent, other parts of their brain get integrated. Eventually they’ll be able to do it on their own.
                <p>VOJ: It sounds a lot like the last book. 
                <p>C: There’s a lot of overlap. Maybe a bit of fine tuning in the discipline area.
                <p>VOJ: Okay, here’s a story about a hermit who really liked time outs.
                A traveler made a long, arduous journey to find a wise hermit.  After searching the wilderness for many weeks, he finally found the old man in his hideaway.  "Tell me about life," said the traveler.  "Well," said the hermit, "life is like a fish."
                The traveler thought on this for a while, then said to the hermit, "How is life like a fish?"
                The hermit sat silently, pondering the question. Seconds turned minutes, minutes turned to hours.  Finally, the hermit said, "Okay, maybe life isn't like a fish."
