              <h1>#20. Me - Nonviolent Communication.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Alright, which book are we talking about today?
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Nonviolent communication!
<p>C: And who's it by?
<p>VOJ: Marshall Rosenberg!
<p>C: And what's it about?
<p>VOJ: Uh, that's your job.
<p>C: Okay, basically it's about a gentler way to communicate.
<p>VOJ: How is it gentler? What's so different about it?
<p>C: Well, you know how sometimes you have a conversation and it doesn't seem to go anywhere. Or like you're not being heard or it's hard to understand what the other person is saying. Or how sometimes the conversation ends up being an argument and you don't know why?
<p>VOJ: Only when I talk to myself.
<p>C: Right. Well, it's usually because we're missing parts about how to communicate.
<p>VOJ: What parts?
<p>C: So NVC has four parts - observation, feeling, needs and request.
<p>VOJ: That's a lot of parts. How come I can't just say what's on my mind? I like just beng honest.
<p>C: Which brings us to the first part. Our gut reaction is the tendency to judge instead of observe. Let's say a friend is telling us about a tough day that their having. Our first thought  might be "I've had tough days too," or " What a complainer! I've heard these complaints before," or "How can I solve their problem?". But what NVC suggests is just simply slowing down and observing, "This person is having a tough day."
<p>VOJ: That's it? What's wrong with the first three options?
<p>C: Well, thinking "I've had tough days too" is about your experience and not about your friend. "What a complainer!" is a judgement that doesn't usually make you a better listener. "How can I solve their problem?", again is about you and you trying to be helpful.
<p>VOJ: What's wrong with that?
<p>C: It's quite possible that some one might be looking for your advice. But usually people are looking for empathy. Even if they say they want advice, turns out they really just want you to listen. 
<p>VOJ: Well, people should just ask for what they want.
<p>C: Sure, that's what's so helpful about NVC. A lot of people don't know they want empathy. Which brings us to the second part - Feelings.
<p>VOJ: Ugh, I hate feelings.
<p>C: Well, probably because your needs aren't being met.
<p>VOJ: Huh?
<p>C: When our needs get met we feel joyful, affectionate, peaceful. And when our needs aren't met, we feel afraid, confused, annoyed.
<p>VOJ: What needs are you talking about? 
<p>C: Connection, physical well being, autonomy, meaning, play, peace.
<p>VOJ: Man, you're needy.
<p>C: Thank you. Most people are. So back to our friend who's having a rough day. Let's observe - What emotion are they having? Sadness? Anger? And getting to the third part - What needs of theirs aren't being met? Being appreciated at work? Having a comfortable space? Having work that gives them meaning?
<p>VOJ: That's a lot of things to observe. 
<p>C: That's what makes listening so fun. It's not just about saying nothing and waiting your turn.
<p>VOJ: So what do you do with all those observations?
<p>C: You can reflect them back to your friend. Hopefully that helps them feel heard and connected.
<p>VOJ: Which is the first need you mentioned!
<p>C: There you go. You're getting it.
<p>VOJ: Okay, how about the fourth part - Requests?
<p>C: So this is useful in situations of conflict or when your needs aren't being met in a relationship. The tendency in an emotionally charged situation is to demand like, "Stop lying to me!" or "Go do this!"
<p>VOJ: Yeah, that doesn't make me feel like doing it when you yell at me.
<p>C: Exactly. So the idea is to communicate your needs and request so the other person can hear it and makes it easier to change their behavior. Rosenberg even gives you a mad libs to make it easier.
<p>VOJ: What is it?
<p>C: The sentence template is this:
When ___  blank, here's where you insert your observation, 
I feel ___  blank, then your feeling, 
because I am needing ___ blank, your need. 
<p>VOJ: Okay, let me try it. When you breathe, I feel relaxed, because I'm needing oxygen. Therefore, I would now like you to keep breathing.
<p>C: Perfect. As you demonstrated, it's also a great way to express appreciation. If you search online for NVC needs and emotions, Rosenberg has a list of both to help you develop your vocabulary. 
<p>VOJ: Okay, can I try another one?
<p>C: Go for it.
<p>VOJ: When we do this podcast, I feel hungry, because I am needing a break. Therefore, I would like for us to get ice cream.
<p>C: I'd like that too. Okay, here's the quote to close out the show:
<p>“All violence is the result of people tricking themselves into believing that their pain derives from other people and that consequently those people deserve to be punished.”
<p>VOJ: Ice cream! Ice cream! Ice cream!
<p>C: Okay, say bye!
<p>VOJ: Byeeee!!!
