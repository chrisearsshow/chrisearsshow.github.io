              <h1>#97. ACT Workbook Part 5.</h1>
							 <p>Alright, let’s cover the last three chapters of this book. Chapter 9 is about exposure and learning to watch the emotions and thoughts without getting fused to them. Part of the process is to not be afraid of them or try to numb them or act on them. To get used to their ebb and flow like the weather.
<p>Emotion exposure can be done naturally in the present moment or by using memories of upsetting events. Then, I can keep a record of the exposure and track how it went. Did I accept or avoid the emotion? Did I experience a change in the intensity of the emotion? Did I act on my urges or use coping behaviors? 
<p>Chapter 10 is about self-compassion and approaches the problem of a defectiveness schema from the opposite direction. It’s about creating positive, loving thoughts and feelings toward myself. 
<p>A self-compassion exercise is to do something loving for myself every day, something I normally wouldn’t do. It should be a special treat. Like getting a massage or reading a favorite book. Or simply taking a quiet walk. 
<p>The first part of Chapter 11 is about retaking a couple of assessments to see if there was any change. On the Self-Care Assessment, my score went from 82 to 90 out of 100 which is in the right direction. The higher the number, the more likely you are to experience happiness in your life. 
<p>On the CES Depression Scale, my score when from 19 to 16. Again, in the right direction. The lower the better.
<p>The second part of the chapter is about having a relapse plan for trigger situations. So for example, a trigger situation might be a friend criticizing me. My coping behavior is to usually avoid that person. But the skilled response is to stay with the emotion, process it, return my feedback and keep socializing. 
<p>This week I did my fifth therapy session and it was emotionally heavy. But maybe I say that every week. The session was more centered on Internal Family Systems and talking to my younger self. Let’s just say there was a lot of crying and I’m still recovering from it even though it was several days ago. Coincidentally my homework was to spend time with my younger self, have compassion for him, and give him butterfly hugs. 
<p>Speaking of hugs, have you ever had that awkward moment when you see a really attractive person and you go to give them a hug, and then you hit the mirror? No? Just me? Just me and my handsome guy problems?
