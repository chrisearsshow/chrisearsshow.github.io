							 <p>Chris: Chapter 7 is about feedback.
<p>Other Voice: Dundundun! Also known as “How to lose friends and make people hate you.”
<p>C: That’s true if you deliver feedback the wrong way.
<p>OV: What’s the wrong way?
<p>C: By not sticking to your own reality, by assuming you know the other person’s motives and intentions, and by not describing the specific behavior you’re observing.
<p>OV: Jeez, that’s a lot that can go wrong.
<p>C: Yeah, it’s probably why we’re not very good about delivering feedback. The thing to keep in mind is having the right attitude.
<p>OV: And what’s that?
<p>C: That you don’t know what’s going on for the other person. Feedback is the start of a conversation, not the end.
<p>OV: Does anyone really know what’s going on?
<p>C: In any interaction, there are three realities. The first area is what I know. This includes my needs, motives, emotions, and intentions. The second reality is my behavior, and that is the area that the other person and I both see. It consists of my words, tone, gestures, and facial expressions. The third reality is the impact of my behavior on the other person, and that’s the area in which the other person is an expert; it comprises of their reactions, emotions, and responses. 
<p>OV: So you don’t know each other’s realities.
<p>C: Exactly. Before feedback, each person can only know two of the three realities. 
<p>OV: What if it’s negative feedback?
<p>C: The authors don’t like that term because they believe all behavioral feedback is positive. Even feedback on problematic behavior is positive, because behavior is something we can change, and feedback on it is an opportunity to improve. They prefer the word “affirmative” to describe feedback on behaviors you appreciate and want to convey as strengths, and “developmental” for feedback on behaviors that you find problematic.
<p>OV: How about I just use the feedback sandwich? One good thing, one bad thing, another good thing.
<p>C: The sandwich misidentifies the problem. The
difficulty is not that the feedback is harsh or negative but that it’s not behaviorally specific enough to be useful. It also contaminates affirmative feedback because it is seen as the ploy that it is - something intended not to provide a learning opportunity, but to manipulate.
<p>OV: So what’s the best way to deliver feedback?
<p>C: Describe your reality and only your reality. Pretend you’re like a video camera and describe the specific behavior you’re observing. Then describe the impact of that behavior on your reality. That recipe can work for both affirmative and developmental behaviors.
<p>OV: Talking about feedback, a student at a business marketing school went up to a pretty girl and hugged her without any warning. The surprised girl said, “What was that?” The guy smiled at her, “Direct sales!” The girl slapped him in the face. “What was that?!” said the boy, holding his cheek. “Customer feedback.”
