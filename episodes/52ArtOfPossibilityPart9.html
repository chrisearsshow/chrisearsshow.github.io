              <h1>#52. The Art Of Possibility Part 9.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The tenth practice is “Being the board”.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: I am bored.
<p>C: Not the verb. The noun. As in boardgames. The idea is to take ownership of things that happen in your life.
<p>VOJ: For everything? 
<p>C: Yeah. Even things that you don’t want happen. 
<p>VOJ: Why would you do that?
<p>C: It’s a way of empowering yourself at no cost to others. Instead of being the victim or blaming others, you focus on what you can do. 
<p>VOJ: But then what about justice?
<p>C: Maybe it’ll happen. Maybe it won’t. Let’s say I’m stopped at a red light and get hit from behind by another car. I can focus all my attention on blaming the other driver. But if I’m being the board, I can take a step back and look at the whole situation. When I drive, it’s a statistical risk that I’m going to get in to an accident.
<p>VOJ: So what happens to the driver who hit you?
<p>C: The usual things probably. Insurance information gets exchanged, the police might show up, you get checked for injuries and eventually you get your car repaired. But by “being the board” you can focus on what’s in your control and managing the risks. Then you can get back to what’s important to you instead of being completely derailed when bad things happen.
<p>VOJ: No story today?
<p>C: Not today. How about a joke?
<p>VOJ: Nooo! I hate car puns. They drive me crazy.
<p>C: Oh, give me a brake.
<p>VOJ: Am I grinding your gears?
<p>C: You must wake up exhausted.
<p>VOJ: Thank you Reddit for all the puns!
