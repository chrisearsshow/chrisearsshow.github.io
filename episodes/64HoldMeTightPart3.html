              <h1>#64. Hold Me Tight Part 3.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The first four of the seven conversations are about getting out of negative spirals and being more emotional responsive to each other. 
<ol>
<li>Recognizing the demon dialogues
<li>Finding the raw spots
<li>Revisiting a rocky moment
<li>Hold me tight
</ol>
<p>Recognizing the demon dialogues is about taking a step back and recognizing the play by play that leads to spiraling and disconnection. Not blaming the other but seeing the repetitive behavior that comes up.
<p>Voice Of Judegement: I complimented you about your hair. Then you ignored me. So I stabbed you.
<p>C: Exactly. Finding the raw spots are about the moments where emotions escalated dramatically and disproportionately out of character. By talking about it, hopefully you get to the deeper, softer emotions like sadness, shame and fear.
<p>VOJ: How dare you ignore me! I will not be ignored! I’m not scared!
<p>C: Revisiting a rocky moment is about redoing it and deescalating it.
<p>VOJ: I’m going to hug you now!
<p>C: Which rolls in to the “hold me tight” conversation which answers two questions, “What am I most afraid of?” and “What do I need most from you?”
<p>VOJ: I’m afraid we’ll never have ice cream. I need you to make ice cream.
<p>C: Great. So now we’re at the next two conversations which promotes
emotional bonding through forgiving injuries and sexual intimacy.
<p>VOJ: Easy, peasy.
<p>C: Actually the forgiving injuries conversation is more involved. There’s six steps. 
<ol>
<li>The hurt partner speaks his or her pain as openly and
simply as possible.
<li>The injuring partner stays emotionally present and acknowledges the wounded partner’s pain and their part in it.
<li>Partners start reversing the “Never Again”, basically revising their script. 
<li>Injuring partners now take ownership of how they inflicted this
injury on their lover and express regret and remorse.
<li>A Hold Me Tight conversation can now take place, centering
around the attachment injury. 
<li>The couple now creates a new story that captures the injuring
event.
</ol>
<p>VOJ: But then sex!
<p>C: Yes, but Synchrony Sex. This is when emotional openness and responsiveness,
tender touch, and erotic exploration all come together. It’s not about sealed off sex (which is focused on releasing sexual tension with little emotion) or solace sex (which is focused on alleviating attachment fears).
<p>VOJ: And then last conversation!
<p>C: Right. The seventh conversation is about creating a future love story about a resilient relationship. It replaces the negative relationship models in our mind with positive ones.
<p>VOJ: Yay! And they lived happily ever after! Here’s a short story:
After my husband and I had a huge argument, we ended up not talking to each other for days. Finally, on the third day, he asked where one of his shirts was. "Oh," I said, "now you're speaking to me."
He looked confused. "What are you talking about?"
"Haven't you noticed I haven't spoken to you for three days?" I challenged.
"No," he said. "I just thought we were getting along."
