              <h1>#23. The Power of Now.</h1>
							  <p>Voice Of Judgement: Now!
<p>Chris: Yes, we're talking about the book "The Power of ...
<p>VOJ: Now!
<p>C: By Eckhart Tolle. 
<p>VOJ: And who told you about the book?
<p>C: A girlfriend had gifted it to me. 
<p>VOJ: Too bad you're not with her NOW!
<p>C: Are you going to do that through this whole thing?
<p>VOJ: Hey, I'm just helping you focus on NOW!
<p>C: I'm going to kill you. Okay, the book is about making the present our focus instead of the past or the future.
<p>VOJ: Why not the past or future?
<p>C: Well, you can't change the past. And the future is out of your control. Thinking about them is just about thinking. A non stop playback loop in your head.
<p>VOJ: I like that loop.
<p>C: Sure, we all have it. Being present is being able to observe that playback loop. Not identifying with it but putting a little distance between you and it.
<p>VOJ: Why?
<p>C: Because that brain chatter causes unnecessary suffering. Most of that thinking is about resisting what is. 
<p>VOJ: So what's the benefit of accepting?
<p>C: You'll be able to flow with life and let life work for you. 
<p>VOJ: That sounds nice. 
<p>C: Doesn't it?
<p>VOJ: So how do you focus on the present?
<p>C: One way is to listen to your body....what are you doing?
<p>VOJ: Putting my ear to my shoulder. It's not saying anything.
<p>C: Okay buddy. Other ways are fasting or being in a state of active waiting.
<p>VOJ: What happens if something painful happens?
<p>C: Surrender to it and be with the emotion. It's normal. Suppressing the feeling and resisting what happens is what gets us in to more trouble.
<p>VOJ: Embracing pain doesn't sound fun.
<p>C: It's a bit like ripping off a band aid, instead of dragging it out. Plus it helps you build up resiliency.
<p>VOJ: Okay, so does that mean I can just hang out and wait for things to happen?
<p>C: Maybe. The idea is to be passive internally while active externally. The thinking part of you is what needs to hang out and chill. Your body and presence is what guides you in to action.
<p>VOJ: Our mind and body are guiding us to pizza!
<p>C: Sounds good. Here's the closing quote:
<p>"You cannot transform yourself, and you certainly cannot transform your partner or anybody else. All you can do is create a space for transformation to happen, for grace and love to enter."
<p>VOJ: TRANSFORMERS!
