              <h1>#65. The Whole Brain Child Part 1.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: “How to raise kids who will survive and thrive?” is the theme of our next book “The Whole Brain Child”.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: But we don’t have any children!
<p>C: True. But it has some great insights into psychology which helps us understand ourselves and how to relate to others. Not just children.
<p>VOJ: So why survive and thrive? Isn’t survive enough?
<p>C: The authors, Daniel Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson, point out that most parents want both for their children but fall short. They’re too busy with the survive part. Like don’t murder your sister. 
<p>VOJ: Hey, she murdered me first!
<p>C: Siegel and Bryson suggest an approach that combines the thrive part with the survive part.
<p>VOJ: Sounds like more work.
<p>C: It does takes a bit more patience. But it’s appealing in a couple of ways. The first is that by understanding the brain and helping your child understand it, eventually the child will be able to self parent. The other is that it’s not about creating rare life experiences that only people with resources can create.
<p>VOJ: But I like having a pony!
<p>C: Right. But when you fall off of it that’s where the whole brain approach comes in. You’ll probably be crying and the emotional right brain has taken over. So how do you bring the logical left brain into the picture?
<p>VOJ: By doing math!
<p>C: Sure. If you like math. Alternatively, the authors provide two strategies. The first is to “Connect and redirect”. Because you’re having an emotional experience, as the parent I use my emotional right brain to connect with you. I attune to your feelings of hurt and we surf the emotional waves together. 
<p>VOJ: How does that bring the logical left brain into the picture?
<p>C: The temptation is to use logic right away but when the emotional right brain is running the show, logic doesn’t help. By attuning to the emotion, the kid’s brain is able to process some of it, allowing the left brain back online.
<p>VOJ: Left brain, right brain, I’m confused.
<p>C: Just look at it as the emotional part and the logical part. As the book goes on we’ll be doing other parts of the brain. The authors do a great job of simplifying the language so that it sticks and translates easily to children.
<p>VOJ: Now you’re a comedian/book salesman.
<p>C: Thanks buddy. Okay the second strategy for dealing with you falling off your pony and crying is to “Name it to tame it”. Basically you talk it out and tell me what happened.
<p>VOJ: How does that help?
<p>C: Again it brings the two parts of the brain together. The logical brain helps put the story together while the emotional brain remembers how you felt.
<p>VOJ: What if I don’t feel like telling the story?
<p>C: Totally fine. You’ll process and come back to me later. Probably while I’m in the shower. Children sometimes like talking while doing something else like  playing with Lego's or lighting the cat on fire. They can also talk to a sibling or imaginary friend.
<p>VOJ: This imaginary friend is tired.
<p>C: Yeah, it’s a brain heavy book. Let’s go take a nap.
<p>VOJ: Yay! Time to follow our dreams!
