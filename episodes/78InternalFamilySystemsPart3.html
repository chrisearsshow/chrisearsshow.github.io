              <h1>#78. Internal Family Systems Part 3.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter three expands on the idea of the many parts of the self and how to lead yourself.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: By taking charge!
                <p>C: Kind of. It’s more like playing a mediator or party host.
                <p>VOJ: I like parties!
                <p>C: Right. So the host’s job is to help everyone get along. It’s when the parts are at war is when the mind gets busy.
                <p>VOJ: So have peace talks.
                <p>C: Basically. Listen to the parts and don’t try to change them. Be curious about them. Eventually they’ll drop their guard and let you know what’s really going on, why they do what they do, and then we can help them change.
                <p>VOJ: So change them by not changing them.
                <p>C: Exactly. Then hopefully they’ll be less at war and be willing to work together.
                <p>VOJ: We’re still talking about one person right?
                <p>C: Yeah, it can take a bit of practice to get used to the idea that each of us is a system of parts.
                <p>VOJ: Okay, so let’s say the war stops. Then what?
                <p>C: A couple of things. One, some of the parts get to heal. Two, the parts get to take on better roles. For example, the inner critic can instead become the cheerleader.
                <p>VOJ: And then what?
                <p>C: Again, a couple of things. One, you’ll often be surprised how dominant one part of you was and how it was driving most of your life. Two, as that part steps back, you’ll be able to enjoy the richness of the rest of your parts.
                <p>VOJ: Well, this inner critic thinks you numbering your points is bound to annoy the listeners.
                <p>C: Probably. Or maybe I’m just cleverly demonstrating how to listen to that voice and others.
                <p>VOJ: Sure. You totally planned that. Okay, joke time!
                A guy walks into a bar, sits down and waits for the bartender. Then he hears a voice, "Nice tie!" He looks around and doesn’t see any one. Then he hears another voice, "Nice shoes!" but still can’t see anyone. Finally the bartender comes over and the guy says, "Hey, I keep hearing voices." Then bartender says, "Oh. That's just the peanuts. They’re complimentary."
