              <h1>#40. Mating In Captivity Part 1.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Alright, I’ll let you introduce the book today.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: “Mating in Captivity!” by Esther Perel!
<p>C: And what’s it about?
<p>VOJ: Why married people don’t have sex!
<p>C: Umm… or how to keep sex interesting in a committed relationship. 
<p>VOJ: Do we need a trigger warning?
<p>C: I doubt kids are listening to this but okay. We talk about sex.
<p>VOJ: [Singing]…Baby, how about you and me, all the good times and the bad times, you and me…
<p>C: So the book has a lot of insights so we’ll break it up in to a few episodes.
<p>VOJ: Yay! Less reading!
<p>C: Yeah, it’s been a bit brutal reading a book a week. Okay, starting with chapter 1. What did we learn here?
<p>VOJ: Modern life means we’re more free but also more lonely. When we date, we want that to fix all the loneliness.
<p>C: Yeah, which leads to wanting predictable relationships. But eroticism thrives on the unpredictable.
<p>VOJ: So how do we fix it?
<p>C: Chapter 2 suggests examining how intimacy and sex are related. More of one can mean less of the other.
<p>VOJ: Aren’t the two supposed to go together?
<p>C: Not in the author’s experience as a couple’s therapist. Sexual excitement requires the capacity not to worry and the pursuit of pleasure demands a degree of selfishness. Some people can’t allow themselves this selfishness because they’re too absorbed with the well-being of their partner.
<p>VOJ: Huh, you care too much about them so you don’t want to have sex with them.
<p>C: Yup. Aggression, objectification, and power all exist in the shadow of desire, components of passion that don’t necessarily nurture intimacy.
<p>VOJ: So how do we fix that?
<p>C: In chapter 3, the author suggests moving away from verbal communication. Relying too heavily on it limits how fully we can convey ourselves. 
<p>VOJ: [Singing] Use your body! Use my body!
<p>C: Right. With one couple, the author has them do physical interactions like leading each
other around the room, pushing against each other with their open hands and
mirroring each other’s movements.
<p>VOJ: Better than talking about feelings!
<p>C: Yeah. Alright, we’ve already quoted the author a lot so let’s stop there.
<p>VOJ: What? No closing quote?! 
<p>C: Yeah. Our podcast is starting to sound too much like fortune cookies.
<p>VOJ: Or like those motivational posters. 
<p>C: Yeah.
<p>VOJ: Or like a magic eight ball. 
<p>C: Okay, we get it.
<p>VOJ: Or like birthday cards.
<p>C: We get it!
<p>VOJ: Or coffee mugs.
<p>C: Okay stop!
