              <h1>#95. ACT Workbook Part 3.</h1>
							 <p>This was another tough episode to write. Intellectually I understand this process is for my benefit but emotionally there’s a lot of resistance. And it’s normally easier to just not think about it. Going through the process puts my brain at war with itself.
              <p>But before we get to that, let’s run through chapter five which is about mindfulness. The authors define it as the ability to watch what’s happening now. 
              <p>One of the exercises is spending thirty seconds focusing on each of the five senses and observing any sensations. My mind wandered so much that I lost track of which sense I was on or how long I was supposed to be mindful for.
              <p>You can do mindfulness with any activity. I tried it with dishwashing and it slowed things down. But again it was hard to maintain focus. 
              <p>The next level is to bring mindfulness to thoughts of defectiveness and coping behaviors. It was hard to not get caught up in the whirlwind of the negative thoughts but I was able to get some small glimpses. Like when I was falling asleep and my brain goes, “Hey, remember that thing that stranger said casually 20 years ago. Let’s take it personally, get angry about it and feel bad about ourselves. Good night!”
              <p>Chapter six is where new choices are made. I’m to look at my values and come up with a weekly goal for better alignment. The goal is usually something that my coping behaviors make difficult to do. Here’s where the brain at war part comes in.
              <p>For me, it’s socializing and forming new friendships. So a possible weekly goal is to regularly hang out with a social group. Covid has made this conveniently challenging but now with virtual environments, I don’t have an excuse. My brain comes up with several rationalizations, “But that’s too much screen time! But you have to work! But it’s too big of a time commitment!”
              <p>Sigh. Okay, we’ll see how it goes. I feel a little ridiculous sharing this as my challenge. Like I’m setting a low bar so that I make sure to accomplish it. “Hey, look at me! I blinked my eyes!” 
              <p>Then there are the other parts of socializing and maintaining relationships that I have trouble with, like asking for what I want, not taking things personally, and being open to feedback and criticism. The chapter talks about planning for those moments of choice in defectiveness-triggering situations but I’m not trying to be a superhero so I’ll save that for future episodes. Let’s take this baby step that feels like climbing Everest for now.
              <p>Also, I did my third brainspotting session where I processed the memory of an old knee injury from a car accident several years ago. I won’t go into the bone-crushing detail but it was interesting watching my body's involuntarily muscle twitch and release some of its trauma. It was probably much needed. There’s something about having a therapist making you stay with the pain that I normally wouldn’t do on my own.
              <p>Alright, here’s a story to close.
              <p>In Jerusalem, a female journalist heard about a very old Jewish man who had been going to the Wailing Wall to pray, twice a day, every day, for a long, long time. So she went to check it out.
              <p>She went to the Wailing Wall and there he was!
              <p>She watched him pray and after about 45 minutes, when he turned to leave, she approached him for an interview.
              <p>“Sir, how long have you been coming to the Wall and praying?”
              <p>“For about 60 years.”
              <p>“60 years! That’s amazing! What do you pray for?”
              <p>“I pray for peace. I pray for all the hatred to stop and I pray for all our children to grow up in safety and friendship.”
              <p>“How do you feel after doing this for 60 years?”
              <p>“Like I’m talking to a wall!”
