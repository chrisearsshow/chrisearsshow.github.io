              <h1>#87. Getting Past Your Past Part 7.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 7 is about body issues and the author opens with a couple of poetry lines, “Oh body, my body, my friend and companion. The biggest betrayer my life’s ever known.”
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: Yeah, our knee was acting up when we were reading this chapter.
                <p>C: We’re lucky to have all our limbs. In the US, there are about 1.6 million people who’ve lost a limb due to accidents, war, or disease. And with that missing limb,  phantom pains can be a common symptom. And that’s just one example of a body issue.
                <p>VOJ: That’s a lot of people.
                <p>C: Then there are the 6 million adults in the US who suffer from panic attacks. Those include the physical sensations of heart palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. 
                <p>VOJ: Okay, a lot a lot of people have body issues.
                <p>C: Then let’s add in the 6 million American children who have been diagnosed with ADHD. That can include symptoms of being unable to sit still, constantly fidgeting, and excessive physical movement.
                <p>VOJ: Great, adults and children with body issues.
                <p>C: Then there’s body dysmorphia which affects up to 10 million people in the US. That’s when people are intensely troubled by their appearance. They look at themselves and see parts of their bodies as misshapen or ugly.
                <p>VOJ: Man, this is a real statistical downer of an episode.
                <p>C: Yeah, the chapter closes with an exercise called Lightstream. The idea is to make physical pain more manageable. Start by concentrating on the body sensations that are disturbing you. If it had a shape, size, or color, what would it be? Then think of a shape, size, or color that you associate with healing. Now imagine that light of this color is coming in through the top of your head and directing itself at the shape in your body. 
                <p>VOJ: Laaaa! Kind of like when the heavens open up and the angels sing. 
                <p>C: Something like that. 
                <p>VOJ: Hey, do you which car the knee family decided to buy?
                <p>C: No. 
                <p>VOJ: They decided to buy a Knee-san! Do you know what kind of knee blows out smoke? 
                <p>C: What kind of knee?
                <p>VOJ: A chim-knee! What do you call a knee that can grant you three magical wishes? 
                <p>C: A ge-knee?
                <p>VOJ: Uh, yeah. That’s not as fun when you guess it.
                <p>C: Well, we are one person.
                <p>VOJ: This podcast is really just mounting evidence of our mental disorder.
                <p>C: Well, it’ll be useful when we enter an insanity plea.
