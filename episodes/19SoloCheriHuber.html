              <h1>#19. Part 2 - There's nothing wrong with you.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Hello, today we're with myself again. Say hello myself.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Hello.
<p>C: Ah, trying a new voice today.
<p>VOJ: Why not? Nobody's listening anyway.
<p>C: Always the voice of optimism. Okay, so let's finish up the second half of Cheri Huber's book, "There's nothing wrong with you."
<p>VOJ: Just everything's wrong with you.
<p>C: Thank you. There's three highlights to share. The first is that fear isn't the problem. It's the resistance to fear. Or resistance to anything.
<p>VOJ: So you should never be scared of anything?
<p>C: No. Being scared is natural. It's usually resisting being scared that gets us in trouble. Let's say I'm afraid of rejection. So I never ask someone out on a date.  But I really like this person or want to be dating. 
<p>VOJ: Sounds pretty miserable.
<p>C: Exactly. So the idea is to embrace the fear and be cool with it. If you get rejected or not, be cool with it. Even be cool with the misery. 
<p>VOJ: So let's say you're scared of spiders, you're supposed to just be okay with spiders?
<p>C: Yup.
<p>VOJ: Like spiders that will bite you and cause your limbs to fall off.
<p>C: Yup.
<p>VOJ: Like spiders that will make you limbless, give you cancer and you die.
<p>C: Yup.
<p>VOJ: Like spiders that kill you and makes your family very sad.
<p>C: Yup.
<p>VOJ: So sad that your sister ends up marrying Matthew.
<p>C: Okay, let's not go that far.
<p>VOJ: Hey, just embrace it. Welcome Matthew to the family.
<p>C: Alright, let's move on. The second highlight is compassion. First, compassion and unconditional love for yourself, which then allows you to have compassion for others. This means loving all parts of yourself. The part that judges yourself, the part that thinks you should be perfect 
<p>VOJ: The part that thinks Matthew is an idiot and not good enough for your sister. 
<p>C: Yes, compassion for that voice and for Matthew. Which brings us to the third highlight of practicing acceptance and compassion which is meditation.
<p>VOJ: Ohmmmm.
<p>C: The idea is to practice being with yourself and all those parts of yourself. To be with your breath.
<p>VOJ: I'm always with my breath.
<p>C: Right, but paying attention to it.
<p>VOJ: Oh my god, I'm not breathing!
<p>C: Yes you are.
<p>VOJ: No, I think I'm a vampire. Look, there's no breath on the mirror.
<p>C: Okay, here's a quote to finish out the show:
"I am not here to be an acceptable person.
I am here to accept the person I am."
<p>VOJ: Amen. 
<p>C: If you're a vampire, can you believe in Jesus?
<p>VOJ: Why not? Vampires can be very accepting.
<p>C: Is that right?
<p>VOJ: Vampires say ohmm.
<p>C: Say bye.
<p>VOJ: Bye!!!
