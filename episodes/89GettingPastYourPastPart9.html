              <h1>#89. Getting Past Your Past Part 9.</h1>
							<p>Chris: Chapter 9 is about how processing memories can rehabilitate violent, anti-social, and criminal behaviors.
              <p>Voice Of Judgement: That’s it?
              <p>C: Yeah, it’s a pretty heavy chapter about addiction, abuse, and violence so for a comedy podcast, we’re not going to cover it.
              <p>VOJ: Sounds like a cop-out.
              <p>C: Probably. This episode is going to wrap up this book so we’re going to be just focusing on the highlights.
              <p>VOJ: Like we’ve really been that in-depth so far.
              <p>C: Anyways. Chapter 10 is about the importance of daily self-care and mental health. It offers an additional exercise for stress reduction that uses the four elements of Earth-Air-Water-Fire.
              <p>VOJ: Like the band.
              <p>C: No, you’re thinking of Earth, Wind & Fire. This is Earth-Air-Water-Fire. Earth is grounding your feet, Air is breathing for centering, Water is salivating in the mouth, Fire is lighting up your imagination.
              <p>VOJ: Salivating in the mouth?!
              <p>C: It’s an indication that you’re relaxed. Normally when you’re stressed, your mouth dries up. It's why sometimes after a stressful event people offer water or tea.
              <p>VOJ: Or vodka!
              <p>C: Right. For the ultimate relaxation. Chapter 10 also talks about how the full EMDR treatment includes three steps: processing the memories of the past that set the basis for the problems, processing the present triggers, and encoding new memories of success by imagining doing well in the future.
              <p>VOJ: I like to imagine we’re going to make lots of money.
              <p>C: And what does that look like?
              <p>VOJ: Swimming in gold coins. 
              <p>C: That sounds painful?
              <p>VOJ: Hey, it’s my future!
              <p>C: Alright. Chapter 11 is the last chapter and it talks about death and spirituality. Processing stuck memories can help one grieve and let go of any resentments. It can also help one gain a sense of greater love and concern for humanity as a whole.
              <p>VOJ: What do you think God is going to say to us when we die?
              <p>C: I don’t know. Hopefully, welcome to Heaven?
              <p>VOJ: That reminds me of a story of two women who go to heaven and they meet St. Peter. He tells them, “You can do anything you want here in Heaven as long as you agree to not step on a duck. They make so much noise.”
              The two women agree and enter heaven. One day, one of the women accidentally steps on a duck and it squawks and screams. St. Peter immediately appears, with an ugly man next to him, and chains him up to the woman. She now has to walk around Heaven chained up to this ugly man.
              The other woman was shocked and was very careful to never step on a duck. After a while, St. Peter appears with a handsome man and chains him to her. The woman is excited and blushes and says to the man, “I’m not sure what I did to get chained to you, but this is great!” The handsome man replies, ”I’m not sure either, all I did was step on a duck.”
