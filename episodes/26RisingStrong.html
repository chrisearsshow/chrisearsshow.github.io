              <h1>#26. Rising Strong.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today's book is "Rising Strong" by Brene Brown.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: [Singing] RISING STRONG! RISING STRONG! 
Sounds like a book about cowboys.
<p>C: Well, the author is from Texas.
<p>VOJ: I hope there's a Mexican standoff.
<p>C: Maybe. It's about how to get back up after falling.
<p>VOJ: Like after you've been shot.
<p>C: Right. Although she might be talking about falling metaphorically. 
<p>VOJ: So is the first thing to check for blood? 
<p>C: Yes. And after that to check on your emotions and to put them first. Not to deny them or disengage them. But to be curious about them.
<p>VOJ: Why? 
<p>C: Well, if we bottle the emotions up instead of processing them, they tend to act as undercurrents running our lives. So instead of learning from our emotions, we act from place of hurt.
<p>VOJ: Okay, so I'm crying while checking for blood. Then what?
<p>C: Then she suggests that you examine the story you're telling yourself. Brown's suggestion is to write an unfiltered first draft.
<p>VOJ: Like how?
<p>C: By completing these sentences: 
<ul> 
<li>The story I’m making up is: … 
<li>My emotions tell me: … 
<li>My body feels: …
<li>My thinking seems: … 
<li>My actions are: …
</ul>
<p>VOJ: Okay, the story I'm making up is that I shouldn't have a bullet in me. My emotions tell me that it hurts. My body feels wet and cold. My thinking seems to be hard to focus. My actions are using my hands to stop the bleeding.
<p>C: Right. So with writing out that story, you get some perspective on it. 
<p>VOJ: How does that help? 
<p>C: Well, now that you've embodied your emotions and own your story, you can take the next step of creating a new story. A revolution is how Brown puts it.
<p>VOJ: Okay, I'm going to put a bullet in the person who put one in me.
<p>C: Sounds good. Here's the closing quote:
<p>"The difference between shame and guilt lies in the way we talk to ourselves. Shame is a focus on self, while guilt is a focus on behavior. There’s a huge difference between I am a screwup and I screwed up. The former is an indictment of our very existence. The latter is acceptance of our imperfect humanity."
