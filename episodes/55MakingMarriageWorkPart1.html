              <h1>#55. Making Marriage Work Part 1.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Alright, we’re starting a new book titled “The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work.”
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Are we going to take forever with this book as well?
<p>C: Yeah, we’re going to do one principle at a time.
<p>VOJ: Ugh.
<p>C: So the book is by John Gottman and Nan Silver. Gottman is a psychological researcher on divorce prediction and marital stability. Silver is a journalist and author specializing in parenting and relationships.
<p>VOJ: I’m bored already. 
<p>C: Alright, here’s something interesting. The book is based on research done in the Seattle Love Lab. Couples were observed behind one way mirrors by a team of scientists, recorded by cameras for their words and facial expressions, and tracked by sensors for signs of stress or relaxation.
<p>VOJ: Must make bathroom time and sexy time awkward.
<p>C: Well, the couples were given some privacy and only monitored from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and not in the bathroom.
<p>VOJ: Booo! Boooooring!
<p>C: Okay, for those who want the short answer to making a marriage work - make it emotionally intelligent. Keep negative thoughts and feelings about each other (which all couples have) from overwhelming positive ones. Instead of creating a climate of disagreement and resistance, embrace each other’s needs.
<p>VOJ: That’s it?
<p>C: Yup.
<p>VOJ: Okay. The end. Let’s go home. Next book please.
<p>C: Before we do that, you’ll like the next part of chapter one. It’s about myth busting.
<p>VOJ: Which myths?
<p>C: Here’s a few. Like why marriage therapy doesn’t work. Or that neuroses or personality problems ruin marriages. And that men are not biologically “built” for marriage.
<p>VOJ: So why doesn’t marriage therapy work?
<p>C: The most common prescription is for couples to do active listening. Which the therapist can do because the client is usually talking about a third party. But hard for couples to do because they’re complaining about each other to each other. That only adds stress to the relationship. Some happy marriages don’t have anything close to resembling active listening.
<p>VOJ: What about the other myths?
<p>C: Let’s take the myth that neuroses or personality problems ruin marriages. Everyone has some form of neuroses. It’s not about finding the person with out them but about learning to recognize and avoid activating them.
<p>VOJ: My neuroses is when we do comedy podcast with out telling a joke.
<p>C: Okay, tell us a joke. 
<p>VOJ: A man approaches a beautiful woman in a large supermarket and asks, “I’ve lost my wife. Can you talk to me for a couple of minutes?” 
The woman goes, “Why?” 
“Because every time I talk to a beautiful woman my wife appears out of nowhere.”
<p>C: Which brings us to the myth that men aren’t built for marriage. That myth came about because men historically had much higher rates of cheating on their spouses. But now that women aren’t working at home as much, their rates of cheating are matching or exceeding the rates of men.
<p>VOJ: Nobody should get married! Here’s a joke about divorce:
My ex-wife still misses me but… HER AIM IS GETTING BETTER.
<p>C: Hey, that’s two jokes. That has to count as comedy.
<p>VOJ: Nobody is laughing at this podcast.
<p>C: We don’t know that.
<p>VOJ: Do you hear anyone laughing?
<p>C: We’re all laughing on the inside.
