              <h1>#63. Hold Me Tight Part 2.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: “What is the basic problem when couples fight?” That’s the next part of the book.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Money or sex!
<p>C: On the surface level, that’s likely. But digging deeper, it’s that couples are emotionally disconnected.
<p>VOJ: So what?
<p>C: Under that disconnection is usually distress that’s asking, “Can I count on you, depend on you? Are you there for me? Will you respond to me when I need, when I call? Do I matter to you? Am I valued and accepted by you? Do you need me, rely on me?”
<p>VOJ: Oh my god, you’re so needy.
<p>C: I should be. Needing others is a primal need that’s essential for survival. That’s why when disconnection happens, the fear part of the brain kicks in and it’s not possible to stay rational.
<p>VOJ: You sound like a baby.
<p>C: And I’ll act like one too. I’ll become demanding and clingy. Or I’ll withdraw.
<p>UVOJ: gh, you’re the worst.
<p>C: And that’s how we spiral in to behavior that pushes each other further and further apart.
<p>VOJ: So why not just be nice when your partner is distressed?
<p>C: Because we’re distracted and focused on our own lives. 
<p>VOJ: Pay attention to me!!!
<p>C: That’s why we’re doing a podcast. It’s a desperate cry for help.
<p>VOJ: We should rename our podcast to “Desperation”. People will love to listen to that.
<p>C: In the next episode, we’ll cover the seven conversations that get you out of the desperation and back in to connection.
<p>VOJ: Two men are hunting deep in the woods one late afternoon.
As the sun sets over the horizon, the two hunters realize they’re lost.
Their cell phones don’t work and they’re in the middle of nowhere. One guy goes, "I remember reading that if you fire three shots in the air, it's a sign of distress for anyone in the area."
The other guy nods and fires three shots into the air. After waiting thirty minutes and seeing no sign of help, they fire three more times. And again, after an hour. They start getting desperate and look at each other.
"I don't think this is working."
The other guy goes, "Yeah, and we're losing all our arrows in the trees."
