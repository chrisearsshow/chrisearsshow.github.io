              <h1>#41. Mating In Captivity Part 2.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Alright, this is the second part of the book “Mating In Captivity” by Esther Perel.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Yay! More sex!
<p>C: Right. So picking up from chapter 4, the author makes the point that features of American society, like democracy and equality, when carried over in to the bedroom, leads to boring sex.
<p>VOJ: Why is that? 
<p>C: Because power struggles and aggression is part of eroticism.  
<p>VOJ: What does that look like?
<p>C: The author gives the example of one of her patients. He doesn’t like it when his wife barks orders at him, like “Wash the dishes!”. But loves it when she throws him around in the bedroom. 
<p>VOJ: So how do you know what the person likes?
<p>C: This brings us to chapter 5. Another part of American society is the “find the problem, fix the problem and work hard at it” approach. Unfortunately passion isn’t logical and is full of contradictions.
<p>VOJ: So what do you do instead?
<p>C: The author suggests looking at it as a paradox to manage and not as a problem to solve. Sustaining desire over time requires working with two opposing forces: freedom and commitment.
<p>VOJ: I guess you can’t just choose one?
<p>C: Exactly. You need both. The tension is what makes it fun and interesting.
<p>VOJ: Okay, then what?
<p>C: Let’s go on to chapter 6 which covers why couples lose their spark.
<p>VOJ: Because of stress!
<p>C: Yes, stress and relationship problems are the more common reasons. The author adds that American attitudes towards sex is another. 
<p>VOJ: America! Does she only talk about one country?
<p>C: The author comes from a multicultural background including Europe and provides nice contrasts to the American examples.
<p>VOJ: Like what?
<p>C: Europeans allow more for being different but equal, versus the American tendency towards sameness. Europeans can be fatalistic versus Americans who are optimistic. And Europeans often see adolescent sexuality as a normal developmental stage instead of an American taboo.
<p>VOJ: So uh, how do you not fix that?
<p>C: The author’s point is that this had led to sex being seen as forbidden and hedonistic. She interviews a college student who shares how the cultural norm is to get really drunk and hook up. Both things they’re not supposed to be doing. 
<p>VOJ: That sounds pretty normal.
<p>C: The downside is that the college student and her friends deliberately attempt to keep emotions out of sex. Relationships are seen as a burden and romance is non-existent. This doesn’t led itself to deep relationships and erotic intimacy. 
<p>VOJ: What’s erotic intimacy?
<p>C: To quote the author:
<p>“Erotic intimacy is the revelation of our memories, wishes, fears,
expectations, and struggles within a sexual relationship. When our
innermost desires are revealed, and are met by our loved one with
acceptance and validation, the shame dissolves. It is an experience
of profound empowerment and self-affirmation for the heart, body,
and soul.”
<p>VOJ: Wow, that makes sex sound amazing. Tell me more!
<p>C: Chapter 7 is where the author talks about how we relate to our parents is how we relate to our lovers. And that those patterns often need to change for better sex.
<p>VOJ: Ugh. Parents. Now I’ve lost interest.
<p>C: Well, for example with one couple, she helps the husband get comfortable with his separateness. Growing up he had developed a habit of being highly attuned to his mother, not allowing space for himself. So when it came to sex with his wife he felt responsible for her and lost his own desire. The wife in turn felt rejected and unwanted.
<p>VOJ: How do they change that?
<p>C: The author suggests the husband masturbate in front of his wife. To attend to his own needs. Over time, instead of waiting for cues from his wife, he learns to follow his own desires and impulses and to take charge. 
<p>VOJ: That sounds kind of “metoo”-y.
<p>C: It does. There’s a certain level of ruthlessness needed. Coming back to erotic intimacy - it holds the double promise of finding oneself and losing oneself. It is an experience of merging and of total self-absorption, of mutuality and selfishness.
<p>VOJ: Man, I need a cigarette.
<p>C: Okay, we’ll stop there and hopefully finish the book in the next episode.
<p>VOJ: This book is taking forever! We’re not going to get done until next year!
<p>C: Actually, yeah, we won’t finish it until next year.
<p>VOJ: Oh yeah, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
<p>C: Season greetings to you too!
<p>VOJ: Happy Hanukkah!
<p>C: Thank you.
<p>VOJ: Joyous Kwanzaa!
<p>C: Don’t do all of them.
<p>VOJ: Yuletide Greetings!
<p>C: You’re going to do all of them.
<p>VOJ: Joyeux Noël!
<p>C: Don’t do all the languages. 
<p>VOJ: Feliz Navidad!
