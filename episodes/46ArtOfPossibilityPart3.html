              <h1>#46. The Art Of Possibility Part 3.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 4 is about being a contribution.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: And I’m back!
<p>C: Yes, you are.
<p>VOJ: Can’t believe you tried to kill me off.
<p>C: Look, editing you in takes twice as long.
<p>VOJ: But I’m worth it!
<p>C: I know. It’s more fun with you around.
<p>VOJ: I’m more fun! I’m more fun!
<p>C: Actually that’s the first part of the practice of being a contribution - declaring that you’re a contribution. 
<p>VOJ: What are the other parts?
<p>C: There’s one more. Throwing yourself into life as someone who makes a difference while
accepting that you may not understand how or why.
<p>VOJ: I’m a contribution! I’m a contribution!
<p>C: Right. So the first story is about how Rosamund, as a therapist, helps a couple, Marianne and Robert, by teaching them the practice of being a contribution. The couple was always running in to money trouble. They worked in academia which didn’t pay well and one of their kids was in college. Another one was about to go. When tax time came around, they usually had to lean on Marianne’s mother who was wealthy. 
<p>VOJ: Problem solved!
<p>C: Except Marianne’s mother would always lecture her and begrudgingly help out. Marianne was angry at herself and her mother for having to go through this every year. Here’s the rest of the story from Rosamund’s perspective:
<p>“Do you suppose your mother likes to see you whining and
groveling for money?” I asked Marianne. “Do you think it will be
satisfying to her to hand out two thousand dollars, and still leave you
miserable, and battling to pay your bills?”
<p>Marianne shook her head and looked up, holding back tears.
“What is the sum of money that would make a real difference,
that would give you and your family ease in your lives and in
planning for the future?” I watched her face struggle to address the
question. The sum that eventually lit up her countenance was twenty
times the amount she had been prepared to request.
<p>I asked Marianne to consider not only the contribution her mother
would be making to the well-being of her family by giving her that
amount of money, but more important, the contribution Marianne
herself might be in her mother’s life, as a daughter whose family was
no longer at the brink of financial disaster. It wasn’t easy for her to
change her viewpoint, to think of herself as a contributory member of
her extended family instead of a failure. But that was the challenge.
She took the risk. She went to see her mother that weekend,
determined to show her enthusiasm over the life she envisioned for
herself and her family, and alive to a possibility for all the generations
in offering her mother the chance to help her realize it.
<p>“How did it go?” I asked when I saw Marianne next, but I knew
the answer from the way she carried herself. She’d had the best visit
of her adult life. Her mother had leapt at the opportunity to do
something demonstrably positive for her daughter.
<p>“But that’s only half the story,” Marianne said, laughing. “When I
got back home, there were messages on my answering machine
from both of my sisters, wanting to know what had gotten into our
mother—she had given each of them an equal sum of money out of
the blue!”
<p>VOJ: Yay! Ask for more money! That solves everything!
<p>C: Or maybe see yourself and others as a contributers. 
<p>VOJ: I want to contribute. 
<p>C: Okay, go for it.
<p>VOJ: A man is walking along a beach and sees thousands of starfish washed up along the shore. A girl is running up and down, picking up the starfish and throwing them back in to the ocean. He says to her, “What difference could it make to save a few out of so many?” She picks one up, throws it back in to the water and says, “It definitely made a difference to that one.”
<p>C: Nice. Making a difference, and accepting that you may not understand how or why. Okay, the third and final story:
<p>Four young men sit by the bedside of their dying father. The old man,
with his last breath, tells them there is a huge treasure buried in the
family fields. The sons crowd around him crying, “Where, where?”
but it is too late. The day after the funeral and for many days to
come, the young men go out with their picks and shovels and turn
the soil, digging deeply into the ground from one end of each field to
the other. They find nothing and, bitterly disappointed, abandon the
search. The next season the farm has its best harvest ever.
<p>VOJ: Wait, there was no treasure?
<p>C: Not in the traditional sense.
<p>VOJ: The end of the story is there’s no treasure?
<p>C: No, the treasure is a great harvest.
<p>VOJ: I’d rather have treasure.
<p>C: You’re missing the point of the story. 
<p>VOJ: Your other story had some one asking for more money and getting it. I liked that story better.
<p>C: The point isn’t about the money!
