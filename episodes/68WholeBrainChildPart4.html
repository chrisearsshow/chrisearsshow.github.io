              <h1>#68. The Whole Brain Child Part 4.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The eighth brain strategy to teach your child is how to let the clouds of emotion go by. 
<p>Voice Of Judgement: By ignoring them with lots of TV and ice cream.
<p>C: That could work. And also helping them realize the difference between feeling an emotion and being an emotion. Being an emotion is dangerous because it can be perceived as a permanent state that’s hard to shift away from.
<p>VOJ: So how do you shift away from it?
<p>C: By using the pre-frontal cortex, the part of the brain that’s behind the forehead that allows you to do higher level thinking. Including how to control what you pay attention to.
<p>VOJ: Wait, you can control that?
<p>C: Yup. Which leads us to the next brain strategy of SIFT. Sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts. All the things that’s going on inside you.
<p>VOJ: Acronyms? You’re teaching your kid acronyms? That’s going to win you parent of the year.
<p>C: It’ll probably say that on my coffee mug. The point of SIFT is to help the child understand that they have happy memories, funny images, angry feelings and sad thoughts. It’s a full experience that’s worth looking in to. You can choose what you pay attention to.  
<p>VOJ: Why is that helpful?
<p>C: Because it allows you to take a step back and look at the whole picture. When you get stuck on one part of yourself, like how you’re feeling frustrated about a tough homework, taking a step back can help you calm yourself and get through the homework. That’s the tenth strategy of getting back to the hub of the brain and using mindsight.
<p>VOJ: SIFT, hub, mindsight. Are you giving a business seminar?
<p>C: Yeah, it’s useful for putting children to sleep.
<p>VOJ: Here’s a story to wake them up:
<p>Observing the baby one night a wife found her husband standing over their baby's crib.
Silently she watched him. As he stood looking down at the sleeping infant, she saw on his face a mixture of emotions: disbelief, doubt, delight, amazement, enchantment, scepticism.
Touched by this unusual display and the deep emotions it aroused, with eyes glistening she slipped her arm around her husband. "A penny for your thoughts," she said.
"It's amazing!" he replied. "I just can't see how anybody can make a crib like that for only $46.50."
