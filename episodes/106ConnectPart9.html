							 <p>Chris: Chapter 10 is about what happens when you push away emotions and don't own them.
<p>Other Voice: Nothing happens!
<p>C: Yes and no. Yes, in that you can choose to numb yourself but that means love and joy also get pushed away. Or the emotions could build up to a boiling point where they blow up.
<p>OV: And that's when we become action heroes.
<p>C: Or we become locked into a rigid position, determined to be right and proving others wrong.
<p>OV: Why are we so bad at owning our emotions?
<p>C: Emotional intelligence is still relatively new.  It's not taught in schools and not many workplaces allow for emotional expression. Even as kids, adults will often discourage us from emotional expression.
<p>OV: How come?
<p>C: Probably because as a parent, it's hard to see your child in pain so it's easier to deny your feelings. Unfortunately, this also sends signals that can negate the child's feelings.
<p>OV: So we're all denying our emotions!
<p>C: Pretty much. Even if we do express our emotions, the tendency is to downplay the intensity. It's only when they pass a high threshold that people notice or report them.
<p>OV: So how do we get better at feeling our feelings.
<p>C: By paying attention to responses in our body like a flutter in our stomach, a
change in our heartbeat, tingling in our neck, tightness in our throat, or damp palms.
<p>OV: It sounds like we're about to get murdered.
<p>C: Or we're falling in love. They sound about the same.
<p>OV: So what do we do if we're stuck?
<p>C: There are a couple of options. The first is to recognize when you're trapped in your ego or false pride. The second is to talk about what's happening in the present moment and what you would like to happen in the future.
<p>OV: What does that look like?
<p>C: In the next chapter, we'll go into a bit more of those details as we talk about how to get out of a logjam.
<p>OV: Speaking of logjams, did you know our Grandfather fought in World War I and World War II?
<p>C: I didn't know that.
<p>OV: I saw him yesterday and he was crying. When I asked him why, he told me, "Many years ago, I was a soldier in World War I. At some point on the battlefield, I saw a German soldier and he saw me so we both aimed at each other. But he was quicker and shot first. Luckily he missed. 
<p>Then later I was fighting in World War II. Again I was on the battlefield and again saw the same German soldier. This time, I aimed first but again he was quicker and shot first. Luckily he missed.
<p>Then today, I got a letter from that German soldier and he says 'I miss you a lot'."
