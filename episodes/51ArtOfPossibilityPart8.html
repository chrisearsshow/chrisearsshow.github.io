              <h1>#51. The Art Of Possibility Part 8.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The ninth practice is lighting a spark in others.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Like setting them on fire.
<p>C: Uh, metaphorically speaking? And there are a few steps. The first is to imagine that people are an invitation for enrollment.
<p>VOJ: I like to imagine all my friends.
<p>C: Or maybe you are the imaginary friend. The second step is to be ready to participate and be moved.
<p>VOJ: Let’s move to Morocco.
<p>C: Why Morocco?
<p>VOJ: It’s fun to say. Morocco!
<p>C: Which is a perfect tie in to the third step which is to offer what lights you up.
<p>VOJ: Light bulbs. That’s what lights me up. I’m going to start giving them to people.
<p>C: Sounds good. Here’s a story from Rosamund Zander about enrolling others and igniting a spark in them:
<p>On an April morning I dusted off my bicycle from its winter
hibernation and pedaled toward the Museum of Fine Arts, a route
that would take me across the Charles River and along the flowering
paths of the Fenway. Finding it hard going over the Boston University
Bridge, I stopped to check my tires and saw that the front one was
nearly flat. Yet I was in luck, for just ahead, at the foot of the bridge,
was a service station whose air pump shone invitingly from across
the road. But not up close: it took a couple of quarters to put it into
operation, and I, traveling lightly, had only a folded ten-dollar bill in
my shirt pocket.
<p>Two big men were in attendance, one at the pumps and one
standing idle. I approached them, my ten-dollar bill outstretched. “Do
you have change for the air pump?” I asked. They shook their heads.
No. It was Sunday, and the till was empty, they explained. I showed
them that my tire was flat and that the air pump wouldn’t work
without two quarters. Again they shook their heads, looking away
and down, their hands in their pockets, shuffling their feet like two
slow bears.
<p>Three unhappy people, a worthless ten-dollar bill, an air pump
standing idle, a bicycle one could not ride, and great art out of reach.
“How unnecessary!” I thought. “How irritating, how petty,” I argued as
I went down in defeat. But nothing changed—there was the idle air
pump, the airless tire, the ten-dollar bill that wasn’t worth the paper it
was printed on, and there we were, we hapless three. . . . With that
last thought my perspective lightened, and I felt a shift. I glimpsed,
for an instant, that the very people I perceived to be blocking me,
their elusive change jingling in their pockets, shared my distress. We
were three unhappy people.
<p>Then a molecular change, a brightening of the day.
“Will you give me two quarters?” I asked, cheerfully, intimately,
my whole self on the wing.
The man before me looked up slowly as though confronted with
an ancient riddle. The onlooker sprung to life. “Yes!” he said,
reaching into his pockets, “I can give you the quarters,” and he
stretched out his hand. And then, suddenly, miraculously, it all
worked: the coins, the air pump, the bicycle, our partnership. Yet the
other gentleman still stood in some confusion. “Do you know a back-
roads route to the Museum of Fine Arts?” I asked. He beamed. The
directions spilled forth as from a horn of plenty.
<p>VOJ: A lot of their stories seem to have people asking for money and getting it.
<p>C: That’s true. The point is that the money gets to do some pretty cool things like bringing the Philharmonic Orchestra of London to a rough neighborhood school in the Docklands district.
<p>VOJ: Why not just bring the kids to the orchestra?
<p>C: They do that too.
<p>VOJ: Ugh.
<p>C: Why are you so grumpy?
<p>VOJ: I’m not grumpy. You’re grumpy.
<p>C: Must be the weather.
<p>VOJ: Play the outro music already!
