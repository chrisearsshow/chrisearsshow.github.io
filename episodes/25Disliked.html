              <h1>#25. The Courage to be Disliked.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today's book is called "The courage to be disliked."
<p>Voice Of Judgement: I don't like you!
<p>C: Well, then we're off to a great start. The book is written by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga. It's their interpretation of Alfred Adler's work. 
<p>VOJ: Who's that?
<p>C: An Austrian psychologist who had worked with Freud.
<p>VOJ: How come he's not as famous?
<p>C: I don't know. Maybe because his ideas were considered rather contrarian?
<p>VOJ: Like what?
<p>C: Well, like the idea that trauma and emotions aren't that important.
<p>VOJ: How's that?
<p>C: Adler thinks we hold on to trauma to tell stories about ourselves to resist changing. And that we mistakenly think emotions drive our actions. When really it's the other way around. 
<p>VOJ: I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE!
<p>C: Right. So Adler would say that you're angrily shouting because you want to angrily shout. And not because anger is driving you to disagreement.
<p>VOJ: What's wrong with that?
<p>C: Well, it leads away from happiness. The definition of happiness being a feeling of contributing to others.
<p>VOJ: Ice cream makes me happy. How does that contribute to others?
<p>C: It doesn't. Sure, it feels good. But that's not happiness.
<p>VOJ: So how do we contribute to others?
<p>C: By being self reliant and by living in harmony with society.
<p>VOJ: Sounds pretty simple. Sounds pretty Zen.
<p>C: That's the whole point. There's a tendency to make life unnecessarily complex.
<p>VOJ: Like how?
<p>C: For example, if your kid isn't doing their homework, your job as the parent is to encourage them. That's it. Not to tell them to do it or yell at them or punish them or even do it for them. Ultimately the consequence of not doing the homework falls on the child. 
<p>VOJ: Like leading a horse to water but not being able to make it drink.
<p>C: Exactly. Separation of tasks is the idea. We tend to overstep which complicates our lives. 
<p>VOJ: Why do we do that?
<p>C: Probably because we desire the recognition from others.
<p>VOJ: Isn't that everyone?
<p>C: That's the problem. It leads to us wanting others to like us. How many people do we want to like us? How much do we want them to like us? That's a moving goal line that's impossible to reach. 
<p>VOJ: So we want people not to like us?
<p>C: We want for it to not matter. To not worry about being liked or not.
<p>VOJ: Huh, sounds care free. Like we've got no problems.
<p>C: Adler would claim that all problems are interpersonal problems. 
<p>VOJ: So we just need to avoid people!
<p>C: Ah, but people are also the source of happiness. If you have nobody to contribute to, how do you be happy?
<p>VOJ: With ice cream!
<p>C: Okay, here's the closing quote:
<p>“A healthy feeling of inferiority is not something that comes from comparing oneself to others; it comes from one’s comparison with one’s ideal self.” 
<p>VOJ: I'm better than you.
<p>C: No, I'm better than you.
<p>VOJ: But you are me.
<p>C: Yeah, so you're better than me.
<p>VOJ: But then you're better than me.
<p>C: Yeah, so we keep getting better.
