<h1>#99. Connect Part 2.</h1>
							 <p>Other Voice: And I’m back!
<p>Chris: Yes, you are.
<p>OV: Why do you keep killing me off?
<p>C: Because you’re more work to edit in.
<p>OV: So why bring me back? 
<p>C: Sigh. It’s more fun with you. 
<p>OV: Ah-ha! I’m an essential worker!
<p>C: Okay, back to the book Connect. We’re covering chapter 3 which is about how much to share with the other person.
<p>OV: Everything! Everywhere! All the time!
<p>C: Sure, if you want to scare the other person away. The author suggests a 15% percent rule. That way you’re still close to your comfort zone and not taking big risks while sharing enough that hopefully the other person will share too.
<p>OV: What does 15% look like?
<p>C: It’s subjective. Talking about therapy might be in your 15 percent zone if you’re thirty-five years old and live in New York but well outside your 15 percent zone if you’re a fifty-five-year-old in rural England. It also helps to think of the impact of what you share and how situationally appropriate it is. 
<p>OV: Like maybe don’t share about how you want to kill your mother if your friend’s mother is dead.
<p>C: Exactly. If the initial 15% is received well, then you can go another 15%. If it’s disastrous, then you pull back a little, and not all is lost.
<p>OV: That’s why I like to cry on first dates.
<p>C: Why?
<p>OV: To see if they’re in it to win it.
<p>C: Well, emotions are important to share. They usually tell us how important something is. 
<p>OV: See? The date is important to me so I cry. 
<p>C: Okay. Talking about emotions, sometimes they’ll be contradictory. Like you might be hurt by someone’s feedback but also grateful they took the risk to raise a difficult topic. In those situations, you may
go silent as you try to determine what the right feeling is.
<p>OV: Nope, I like to laugh-cry!
<p>C: Right. A common mistake related to emotions is to say “I feel” when it is “I think”. For example, the phrases “I feel that you want to dominate” and “I think you want to dominate” convey the same meaning—because both are cognitions, not feelings.
<p>OV: Why does it matter?
<p>C: Think of the difference between “I feel irritated and
dismissed” and “I feel that you don’t care.” The former shares my internal experience. The latter contains no feeling words but probably has unstated feelings underlying it, and is about the other person’s internal experience.
<p>OV: If emotions are so valuable, why don’t we share them more?
<p>C: I’m not sure. I guess that historically, we didn’t have the time or know about them. Mental health is a relatively modern concept.
<p>OV: That’s why everyone should cry on first dates!
<p>C: Which brings us to vulnerability. It's when you’re disclosing something and it feels risky and you’re uncertain what the impact will be. Like sharing something you’ve never said to anyone. So crying doesn’t always mean you’re being vulnerable. 
<p>OV: Fine. So what would be vulnerable? 
<p>C: An example is sharing something that might cause people to doubt your competence at your job or cause a loss of influence and respect.
<p>OV: Why not just be silent then?
<p>C: Because then people will fill in the blanks. When we are too
reserved with our feelings, we lose control over how we are
seen.
<p>OV: That’s why we look great on Instagram.
<p>C: That’s a different kind of silence. We’re only sharing an image of ourselves. Even if we are
successful in selling our image, it’s a hollow victory. It just
confirms that the real me is undesirable.
<p>OV: Oh my god, it’s so complicated.
<p>C: That’s a good thing. Too often, people think they have no choice in how to respond when in reality they have a lot more agency and choices. Throughout this book, we’ll see a variety of approaches.
<p>OV: Well, at least I know what to say to our sister when she cries.
<p>C: What?
<p>OV: Are you having a crisis?
<p>C: Ugh, now you’re making me cry.
<p>OV: And here’s a story to close: A wife decides to go on vacation, and leaves her husband in charge of her mother and her cat. After a few days, she calls her husband and asks, “How is everything going?” He says, “The cat is dead.” She cries out, “What?! Why couldn’t you have broken the news slowly? You could have said the cat is playing on the roof on the first day, and the next day, say it broke its leg, then the next day, say that the poor thing is dead. It’s better to tell me bad news slowly. Anyways, how’s my mom?” He replies, “She’s playing on the roof.”
