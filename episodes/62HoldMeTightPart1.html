              <h1>#62. Hold Me Tight Part 1.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: “What is love?” That’s the question that part one in the book “Hold Me Tight” answers.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Yay! New book!
<p>C: Yeah, but it’s going to be emotionally intense.
<p>VOJ: Why?
<p>C: It’s by Dr. Susan Johnson, a psychologist who co-created emotionally focused therapy.
<p>VOJ: Why did she do that?
<p>C: Johnson had success working with individuals and families but not with couples. She realized the rational approach wasn’t working. Because like a parent child relationship, love relationships are emotional bonds. They’re about the innate need for safe emotional connection. So she created a way for couples to tap into the emotion. 
<p>VOJ: That sounds nice.
<p>C: It wasn’t always understood that way. Historically, emotional bonds were seen as a hindrance. For example, the conventional wisdom to raising children was to not coddle them and to be as detached as possible. In the 1950s, parents dropped their sick children off at the front door of hospitals because they weren’t allowed to stay with them. 
<p>VOJ: Hey, you’re sick! Let’s drop you off at this strange place by yourself! 
<p>C: Yeah. We understand a bit better now that loving contact is as important as physical nutrition.  
<p>VOJ: But how do you not create overdependent children who grow up into incompetent adults?
<p>C: This brings us to attachment theory and the “Strange situation” experiment.
<p>VOJ: Dun, dun, dun! That's sounds scary.
<p>C: The experiment is where a researcher invites a mother and her child
into an unfamiliar room. After a few minutes, the mother leaves the
child alone with the researcher, who tries to offer comfort if needed.
Three minutes later, the mother comes back. Some of the children would be upset and have difficulty self soothing. But other children were more resilient and trusted that their mother would return. They were more securely attached.
<p>VOJ: What’s the attachment theory part?
<p>C: We’re skipping ahead a few steps but the point is that the securely attached children ended up being more independent and functional adults.
<p>VOJ: So you still haven’t answered the question, “What is love?”
<p>C: Looking at history again, there were different definitions. Love was seen as a simple short-lived, disguised sexual infatuation. Or it was a moral stance, a selfless sacrifice that is all about giving rather than needing or getting. 
<p>VOJ: Sounds about right.
<p>C: What Johnson suggests is that love is an important survival mechanism. To turn to others for help and emotional support is a sign of strength.
<p>VOJ: But that makes us weak and reliant on others.
<p>C: The idea of complete independence and self-sufficiency is a myth. For example, historians observed that in the death camps of World War
II, the unit of survival was the pair, not the solitary individual. Another example is that married people generally live longer than those who are single. Turns out, emotional isolation is a more dangerous health risk than smoking or high blood pressure.
<p>VOJ: And here we are talking to ourselves.
<p>C: Yeah, it’s not great. It goes with the current trend that everyone’s social isolation is increasing.
<p>VOJ: So a guy is walking with a young boy into the woods. The boy goes, “Hey Mister, it's getting dark out and I’m scared” The man replies, “How do you think I feel? I have to walk back alone.”
