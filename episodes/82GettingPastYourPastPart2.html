              <h1>#82. Getting Past Your Past Part 2.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: In chapter two, the author talks about how she discovered EMDR.
                <p>Voice OF Judgement: From dancing at EDM concerts.
                <p>C: Close. She was walking in the park when she noticed that thoughts that had been bothering her had disappeared. She brought those thoughts back in to her mind and for some reason they didn’t have the same “charge” to them. 
                <p>VOJ: Where does the eye movement come in?
                <p>C: She observed that when disturbing thoughts came to her mind, her eyes would move rapidly back and forth diagonally in a certain way. So she did it intentionally with certain memories and again they lost their charge.
                <p>VOJ: That’s it?
                <p>C: Yup. Initially people were skeptical that something as simple as eye movement could be helpful. But after several research studies several professional organizations, such as the American Psychiatric Association, now recognize EMDR as an effective treatment for trauma.
                <p>VOJ: In the last chapter you said it wasn’t just eye movement.
                <p>C: Right. It can also be alternate tapping from hand to hand or tones played from one ear to the other. It’s different ways of refocusing your attention.
                <p>VOJ: How does that help process memories?
                <p>C: The memory control center of the brain is the hippocampus. Because of trauma, the hippocampus shrinks and making new memories becomes harder. But through MRI studies, they discovered that after EMDR the hippocampus would increase in size. 
                <p>VOJ: Why does it do that?
                <p>C: The theory is that it’s like REM sleep where your eyes move back and forth. REM sleep is crucial for memory consolidation and learning retention.
                <p>VOJ: So why not just go to sleep?
                <p>C: That’s one option. But people with PTSD often have difficulty sleeping. The past feels like the present and it’s hard to shake the hyper vigilance.  
                <p>VOJ: Would meditation help?
                <p>C: Sure, if you can pull it off. Our brains are association machines and it’s hard for disturbing memories to not creep in. It’s why Zen masters spend years practicing to hold focus on breath, chants or mantras.   
                <p>VOJ: My brain associates Zen with this story: 
                A Zen student went to a temple and asked how long it would take him to gain enlightenment if he joined the temple. "Ten years," said the Zen master. "Well, how about if I really work hard and double my effort?" "Twenty years."
                <p>C: Yeah, it’s probably that hard.
                <p>VOJ: Here’s another:
                A zen student asked his master: “Is it okay to use email?”
                “Yes”, replied the master, “but with no attachments.”
                <p>C: Ugh.
                <p>VOJ: Final one. A Zen master visiting New York City goes up to a hot dog vendor and says, "Make me one with everything." The hot dog vendor fixes a hot dog and hands it to the Zen master, who pays with a $100 bill. The vendor puts the bill in the cash box and closes it. "Excuse me, but where’s my change?" asks the Zen master. 
                The vendor responds, "Change must come from within."
