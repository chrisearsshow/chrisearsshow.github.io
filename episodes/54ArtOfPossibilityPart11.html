              <h1>#54. The Art Of Possibility Part 11.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The twelfth practice is “Telling the WE story”.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Finally! WE are done with this book!
<p>C: Yeah, we definitely took our time with this one.
<p>VOJ: So how do WE tell the WE story?
<p>C: It’s about seeing what connects us all and treating those connections as an emerging entity. We ask ourselves “What’s best for us all?”
<p>VOJ: How are we supposed to know what’s best for others?
<p>C: Sometimes you don’t. But you can still work on the relationship. Here’s a story from Rosamund that demonstrates this:
<p>My sister and I became guarded with each other in the weeks
and months after our mother died. I don’t think either of us had a
handle on what it was about, but I, in my characteristic way, was
eager to roll up my sleeves and iron out some issues with her. She,
less given to argument, preferred to keep her distance. Many is the
time I drove through the streets of Boston presenting my case in the
most cogent terms to a full courtroom just beyond the dashboard,
while she was safely closeted a state away.
<p>My birthday came and went and still we had not managed to get
together; of course I felt all the more put upon. Finally I had the
grace to ask myself, “What’s happening here?” and I caught a
glimpse of the in-between. All the energy I had been expending to
shape a persuasive argument was actually propelling us apart. And I
missed her—acutely. I thought that if I could just see her we surely
could find some solutions. 
<p>So I called her, and invited myself to her
house for breakfast, and got up in the dark and was down in
Connecticut by seven. There in the kitchen in her nightgown I found
her, looking like my favorite sister in all the world.
<p>We talked gaily while we drank black Italian coffee, and then we
took a long morning walk down the leafy dirt roads of Ashford,
Connecticut, while her chocolate Lab, Chloe, ran ahead and came
back, ran ahead and came back, in long arcs of perpetual motion.
<p>What did we talk about? The architecture, and the countryside,
and the cats that Chloe was eager to visit at the farm ahead. We
revisited scenes featuring our hilarious mother. We talked about my
work, and about a paper she was about to present. My “case” never
came up; it must have gotten lost somewhere along that wooded
road because by the time I got in the car—my courtroom, my
favorable jury—it was no longer on the docket.
<p>Did we resolve the issues? Obviously not, but the issues
themselves are rarely what they seem, no matter what pains are
taken to verify the scoreboard. We walked together, moved our
arms, became joyous in the sunlight, and breathed in the morning. At
that moment there were no barriers between us. And from that place,
I felt our differences could easily be spoken.
<p>Sure, that might work for two people. But what happens if groups of people are fighting?
<p>C: The Zanders address this by talking about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa:
<p>Mandela’s post-apartheid, fully representational South African
government confronted the dilemma that faces every nation
emerging from a long period of savage violence. What attitude do
you take toward the perpetrators, the people whose very existence
intensifies bitterness and hatred in an already wounded society?
What policies do you adopt to heal the nation?
<p>To address this question, the South African government put into
place a framework for the possibility of the integration of all aspects
of society, and appointed Archbishop Desmond Tutu as its chairman.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) offered amnesty to
individuals who were prepared to tell the whole truth, publicly, and
could prove that their violent deeds had been politically motivated. If
an individual chose not to appear before the Commission, he or she
agreed to be tried in conventional ways. Written into the South
African constitution was the vision of the TRC: “a need for
understanding, but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not
for retaliation, a need for ubuntu [brotherhood] but not for
victimization.”
<p>It might seem that Mandela’s government took a huge risk by
instituting the Truth Commission. After all the atrocities, wouldn’t
justice have to be served? Might not people otherwise take the law in
their own hands? But the TRC appears to have been founded on
another story, the story that we really are our central selves longing
to connect, seeking a structure that supports us to dissolve the
barriers. 
<p>More “truth” was revealed than anyone had imagined was
hidden, coming to light by degrees throughout the proceedings of the
TRC. As one story after another emerged, the dualistic definitions of
victims and perpetrators shifted and new patterns were formed…. 
<p>It was not uncommon to see the perpetrators break down in tears as they
described their actions to the very families they had violated.
As a young woman realized, having just heard a policeman tell
how he had killed her mother: “The TRC was never supposed to be
about justice; it’s about the truth.” 
<p>And, as Mandela said, the Truth Commission “helped us to move
away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future.” It
left the society free to take the next step.
<p>VOJ: That was super serious. When do we be funny?
<p>C: Okay, you tell a joke after I do the closing quote. It’s from William James, an American philosopher and psychologist.
<p>I am done with great things and big plans, great
institutions and big successes. I am for those tiny,
invisible loving human forces that work from
individual to individual, creeping through the
crannies of the world like so many rootlets, or like
the capillary oozing of water, yet which, if given
time, will rend the hardest monuments of human
pride.
<p>VOJ: Joke time! Two cows are standing in a field. One cow says "Hey did you hear about that outbreak of mad cow disease? It makes cows go completely insane!". The other cow replies "Good thing I'm a helicopter!"
