              <h1>#37. Being Mortal.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today’s book is titled “Being Mortal” and is by Atul Gawande.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: There’s no way you said his name right.
<p>C: Luckily he’s a surgeon and best selling author so he’s not going to hear this.
<p>VOJ: Is the book about killing his patients/living forever?
<p>C: No, it’s about how the Western medicine approach to aging is lacking.
<p>VOJ: Like how?
<p>C: In several ways. One way is that doctors aren’t trained to have hard conversations when the prognosis isn’t looking good and the problems are no longer fixable. 
<p>VOJ: How are they trained?
<p>C: Doctors are trained to either make the decisions for the patient or to inform the patient their options and let them decide for themselves. The author suggests a third approach where the doctor’s role is to help patients determine what they want. Like an interpreter. This means asking hard questions.
<p>VOJ: Like which questions?
<p>C: There’s five of them.
What is your understanding of where you are and your illness?
What are your fears and worries for the future?
What are your goals and priorities?
What outcomes are unacceptable to you?  What are you willing to sacrifice and not willing to sacrifice?
What does a good day look like for you?
<p>VOJ: Those are some thinking questions!
<p>C: Yeah, when the palliative care doctor Susan Block asked her own father those questions, his answer was, “Well, if I’m able to eat chocolate ice cream and watch football on TV, then
I’m willing to stay alive. I’m willing to go through a lot of pain if I have
a shot at that.” Block’s response was, “I would never have expected him to say that. I
mean, he’s a professor emeritus [of psychology]. He’s never watched a football
game in my conscious memory.” 
<p>C: Guess you never know until you ask. 
<p>VOJ: Yeah, which leads to the author’s larger point that the sick and the elderly have other priorities outside of safety and longevity and suggests our institutions and culture allow for them.  
<p>C: What other priorities?
<p>C: The closing quote is a perfect way to answer that:
<p>“In the end, people don't view their life as merely the average of all its moments—which, after all, is mostly nothing much plus some sleep. For human beings, life is meaningful because it is a story. A story has a sense of a whole, and its arc is determined by the significant moments, the ones where something happens. Measurements of people's minute-by-minute levels of pleasure and pain miss this fundamental aspect of human existence. A seemingly happy life maybe empty. A seemingly difficult life may be devoted to a great cause. We have purposes larger than ourselves.” 
<p>VOJ: Atul Gawande.
<p>C: Stop that.
<p>VOJ: I’m just saying his name. Atul Gawande.
<p>C: Really stop that.
<p>VOJ: Atul Gawande.
<p>C: You’re being racist.
