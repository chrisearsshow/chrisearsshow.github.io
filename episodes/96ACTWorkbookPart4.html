              <h1>#96. ACT Workbook Part 4.</h1>
							 <p>Man, the last episode feels like ages ago. I went to a couple of meetups this week and it’s been a flood of information and emotions. But before we get to that, let’s cover a couple of chapters of the book.
<p>Chapter 7 is about defusion. The concept is to not fuse with your negative thoughts and to be able to separate your identity from your transitory thoughts. The general idea is to notice your thoughts, acknowledge them, and let them go. Specifically, there are eleven ways to do this and they are:
<ol>
<li>Naming Your Mind
<li>Thanking Your Mind
<li>Scheduling a Time to Worry
<li>Sorting Thoughts into Categories
<li>Having (Not Being)Your Experiences
<li>Labeling Thoughts
<li>Repeating Thoughts in a Silly Voice
<li>Putting Thoughts on Clouds
<li>Objectifying Thoughts
<li>Physically Letting Go
<li>Card Carrying
</ol>
<p>“Having (Not Being)Your Experiences” means whenever I have a disturbing thought, to rephrase it by adding to the beginning of it “I’m having the thought that . . .” And then the disturbing thought. 
<p>“Objectifying Thoughts” is giving the thought a color, texture, and shape.
<p>“Card Carrying” is writing down my distressing thoughts on a card. Eventually, the thoughts will repeat, and since I’ve already written them down, my brain can let them go. 
<p>I can expand that exercise further by adding to the card a feeling that comes with the negative thought and a goal that aligns better with my values. So for example, a frequent thought that I have is that “I’m not enough” and the feelings that comes with it are “smallness and fear” and the goal is “to do less”. 
<p>Chapter eight is about avoidance and exposure. The concept is to change how I relate to emotional pain. I can’t prevent defectiveness feelings or avoid feeling them or change them. But I can observe them, accept them and change my behavior. 
<p>The exercise in this chapter that jumped out at me is “Developing an Observer Self”. So whatever memory I’m reliving or playing back in my mind, I’m to notice that I’m also an observer of the memory and not just a participant. It’s a good way to gain a bit of detachment or separation from the negative thoughts and memories.
<p>Which has been tremendously useful for when I socialized this week.
<p>The first meetup was an online book club. Initially, there was a ton of planning that went on inside my head but then it turned out to be a simple click of a button. And during the meetup, I couldn’t stop the butterflies and sweating for the first hour. But everyone was incredibly sweet and careful about sharing air time. It was only after the meetup when all the defectiveness thoughts came crashing in.
<p>Ah, this is why socializing is so exhausting. It’s the playback in my head that doesn’t stop. I start thinking about all the things I said wrong or wish I said better or didn’t say. It felt like I had forgotten how to speak and I was a little freaked out that my brain was broken. Thankfully here’s where the defusion exercises helped me finally unwind after a few hours. 
<p>So then the next day, an in-person meetup showed up on the website that piqued my interest and was about having in-depth discussions. Again, my brain kicked in and gave me all the reasons why I shouldn’t go. But hey, it’s about changing behavior right? And this time it went way better. 
<p>I had forgotten how different it is to be socializing in person versus being online.  So much timing, rhythm, and body language get lost over an Internet connection. I’m so focused on not interrupting and how I look on video, that it’s hard to for me relax. At the second meetup, words flowed way easier and I was relieved that I still remembered how to talk.
<p>So overall, it was incredibly fruitful going to both. I got a chance to defuse my defectiveness thoughts and change my behavior.
<p>I also did my fourth therapy session this week. It’s shifting away from brainspotting and towards somatic experiencing, which is basically paying attention to what’s happening in the body and physical experiences. What came up in that session was a memory of being three years old and finding my mother passed out in the bathroom in the middle of the night. I had heard a thunk in the bathroom and found her. What happens after that I’m a little fuzzy but apparently, I was able to wake my dad who took her to the hospital. It was incredibly lucky that I found her because she was bleeding.
<p>Anyway, in the session, we also spent time maintaining eye contact and getting to a self-limiting belief that my needs don’t matter and that I’m selfish. Not sure where that comes from but I’ll keep you posted if I find out.
<p>Alright, to close here’s a joke that made me laugh. What is Whitney Houston's favorite kind of coordination? Hand and eye. Get it? Haaaaaaand eyeeeeieeeeyeye!
