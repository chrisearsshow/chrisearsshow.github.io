              <h1>#81. Getting Past Your Past Part 1.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: We’re starting a new book called “Getting past your past” by Francine Shapiro.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: By forgetting what happened!
                <p>C: The problem with that is our brains don’t work that way. Some memories will fade in to the background but others will stay in the forefront of our minds.
                <p>VOJ: What makes the memory stay?
                <p>C: It’s usually when the memory is unprocessed.
                <p>VOJ: So how do you process it? 
                <p>C: With EMDR therapy, which stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. 
                <p>VOJ: Oh man, that’s a long name.
                <p>C: Yeah, the name got longer as the therapy process evolved. The author has since discovered that it isn’t just eye movement and would rename it reprocessing therapy but the name stuck.
                <p>VOJ: Okay, why does it even matter if we have unprocessed memories?
                <p>C: Because it leads to unconscious behaviors that are no longer healthy for us. For example, Janice had a history of taking too many antacids and they were ripping up her stomach. Through therapy she discovered this unprocessed memory of being in grade school and the girl next to her vomiting. It got into Janice’s hair and she felt humiliated. After processing that memory, she didn’t feel the need for the antacids.
                <p>VOJ: Huh, that was an easy fix.
                <p>C: Sounds like it. Before we wrap up, the author wants to emphasize in this first chapter, that these memories don’t have to a major trauma to have a lasting effect and that processing the memory isn’t about blame. The idea is to better understand ourselves and ultimately, people around us.
                <p>VOJ: [Singing] “Memories bring back you!” And now time for a joke:
                An 80-year old couple were having trouble remembering things, so they decided to go to their doctor to make sure nothing was wrong with them. When they arrived at the doctor’s office, they explained to the doctor the problems they were having.
                After checking the couple out, the doctor told them that they were physically okay but might want to start writing things down, making notes to help them remember things. The couple thanked the doctor and left.
                Later that night while watching TV, the old man got up from his chair and his wife asked: “Where are you going?”
                He replied: “To the kitchen.”
                She asked: “Will you get me a bowl of ice cream?”
                “Sure.”
                Then his wife asked him: “Don’t you think you should write it down so you can remember it?”
                “No, I can remember that.”
                “Well, I also would like some strawberries on top. You had better write that down cause I know you’ll forget that,” his wife said.
                “I can remember that, you want a bowl of ice cream with strawberries.”
                She replied: “Well, I also would like whipped cream on top. I know you will forget that. You had better write it down.”
                With irritation in his voice, he said: “I don’t need to write that down, I can remember that.” He went into the kitchen.
                After about 20 minutes, he returned from the kitchen and handed her a plate of bacon and eggs.
                She stared at the plate for a moment and said: “You forgot my toast.”
