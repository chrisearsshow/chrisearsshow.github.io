              <h1>#75. No Drama Discipline Part 6.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: In the last episode, we got a bit lazy and didn’t cover the three outcomes we want from discipline. Which again are:
                <ol>
                <li>Insight
                <li>Empathy
                <li>Integration and the repair of ruptures
                </ol>
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: So now you’re repairing that rupture!
                <p>C: Right! So real quick, insight is about the child being able to reflect on their own emotional experience and behavior. Empathy is about the child acknowledging the impact of their actions on others and how others are feeling. Integration and repairing is about learning from mistakes and taking action after making bad decisions. Basically, it’s developing perspectives of “me,” “you,” and “we”.
                <p>VOJ: Well, hopefully we’ve learned our lesson about skimming over material.
                <p>C: Uhh, well about that. This last chapter is about the acronym REDIRECT. Again, they seem pretty self explanatory so maybe we won’t get in to all of them?
                <p>VOJ: Ugh, you’re so lazy.
                <p>C: Yes, we are. Okay, REDIRECT is an acronym for a collection of strategies to keep in mind when disciplining your child. They are:
                <ul>
                <li>Reduce words
                <li>Embrace emotions
                <li>Describe, don’t preach
                <li>Involve your child in the discipline
                <li>Reframe a no into a conditional yes
                <li>Emphasize the positive
                <li>Creatively approach the situation
                <li>Teach mindsight tools
                </ul>
                <p>VOJ: Who can keep all of that in their head?
                <p>C: The authors kindly provide refrigerator printouts to help with that. The idea is to communicate an overall philosophy for the whole family and not to just bring in discipline when you want to control bad behavior.
                <p>VOJ: You’re not going go over any of the strategies?
                <p>C: Just a couple. “Describe, don’t preach” is sharing your observations of their actions and the impact. With a toddler we might say, “Uh-oh, you’re throwing the cards. That makes it hard to play the game.” 
                <p>VOJ: Instead of “Hey kid, cut that out.” And then monologuing. 
                <p>C: Exactly. And the author shares a personal example of involving the child in the discipline. 
                Tina tells the story of a time when her four-year-old absolutely
                had to have a treat—specifically, a bag of fruit snacks—at nine-
                thirty in the morning. She told him, “Those fruit snacks are
                delicious, aren’t they? You can have them after you have a good
                lunch in a little while.”
                He didn’t like Tina’s plan and began to cry and complain and
                argue. She responded by saying, “It’s really hard to wait, isn’t it?
                You want the fruit snacks, and I want you to have a healthy lunch
                first. Hmmm. Do you have any ideas?”
                She saw his little cognitive wheels turn for a few seconds, then his
                eyes got big with excitement. He called out, “I know! I can have one
                now and save the rest for after lunch!”
                He felt empowered, the power struggle was averted, and Tina was
                able to give him an opportunity to solve a problem. And all it cost
                her was allowing him to have one fruit snack. Not such a big deal.
                <p>VOJ: Tina sounds like the perfect parent. 
                <p>C: Well, the authors also want to acknowledge that there’s no such thing as the perfect approach and the perfect parent. The good news is that you can always reconnect and make a change for the better. 
                <p>VOJ: Change for the better! Change for the better!
                <p>C: The authors close the book by sharing stories of their own failings. One of them even goes to their kid, “If you stick that tongue out one more time, I’m going to rip it out of your mouth!”
                <p>VOJ: And that kid is now no longer speaking.
                <p>C: And the author is in jail.
                <p>VOJ: Really?
                <p>C: No.
                <p>VOJ: I always thought that silence is golden. Unless you have children. Then silence is suspicious.
                <p>C: We’re going to make great parents.
                <p>VOJ: We should clone ourselves and then raise ourselves. Then we can literally self parent.
                <p>C: I’m just glad we get to do another book now.
