              <h1>#21. Emotional Intelligence.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today, we're talking about emotional intelligence by Daniel Goleman.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Ugh, another touchy feely book?
<p>C: What's wrong with that?
<p>VOJ: How many of these are we going to do?
<p>C: Until we run out?
<p>VOJ: Why don't we do one about how to murder people and get away with it?
<p>C: I don't know if that that one's been written.
<p>VOJ: We could write it!
<p>C: How would you kill someone?
<p>VOJ: Cough on them and give them Covid.
<p>C: Uh, too soon perhaps?
<p>VOJ: Fine, talk about your book.
<p>C: Okay, emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive and manage your own emotions and the emotions of others.
<p>VOJ: Alright, what am I feeling right now?
<p>C: Silly.
<p>VOJ: You got it!
<p>C: Thank you. I'm becoming more aware of my emotional states. Which is one of the ways to develop your EQ.
<p>VOJ: What's that? 
<p>C: Emotional Intelligence.
<p>VOJ: What's the Q stand for?
<p>C: Umm, maybe quotient?
<p>VOJ: But you didn't say quotient.
<p>C: No, I didn't. It's like IQ. 
<p>VOJ: Then shouldn't emotional intelligence be EIQ? 
<p>C: Okay, buddy, I don't come up with these terms. 
<p>VOJ: Fine. Talk more about your equaly thingy.
<p>C: Okay, there are a few ways to practice EQ for yourself. Like thinking before reacting, moving on after you make a mistake, delaying gratification, emotional self regulation and self motivation.
<p>VOJ: How do you self regulate?
<p>C: Let's say you get angry because some one cuts you off in traffic. You can reframe the situation. Maybe now your attention is drawn back to driving instead of daydreaming and that's safer. Or maybe this is an opportunity to practice compassion and forgiveness.
<p>VOJ: So be the nice guy.
<p>C: Maybe. It's more about you being able to go about the rest of your day. Self regulation is also about noticing when you're depressed or anxious and stabilizing those moods.
<p>VOJ: How do you do that?
<p>C: With depression, exercise can be helpful. And with anxiety, relaxation techniques can be helpful.
<p>VOJ: Okay, but that's all about yourself. How about dealing with others?
<p>C: Sure. With others, EQ can be practiced by being able take criticism, or holding boundaries, or sharing your feelings, or listening with empathy and with out judgement.
<p>VOJ: You're the worst human on planet!!!
<p>C: Okay, where did that come from?
<p>VOJ: I'm letting you practice your ability to take criticism.
<p>C: Thank you. If I was agitated, I would take a twenty minute time out.
<p>VOJ: Twenty minutes? Why that long?
<p>C: Seems to be the number needed for a reset. Four four breathing also helps.
<p>VOJ: What's that?
<p>C: Four count exhale, four count hold, four count inhale, four count hold. Supposedly Navy Seals use it.
<p>VOJ: And yoga instructors!
<p>C: Yes. Okay, anything else you want to add?
<p>VOJ: Nope, I've been practicing delayed gratification. I am a marshmallow.
<p>C: Alright, let's go get two. Here's a story quote to close out the show:
<p>â€œA belligerent samurai once challenged a monk to explain the concept of heaven and hell. The monk replied with scorn, "You're nothing but a lout - I can't waste my time with the likes of you!"
His very honor attacked, the samurai flew into a rage and, pulling his sword from its scabbard, yelled "I could kill you for your impertinence."
"That," the monk calmly replied, "is hell."
Startled at seeing the truth in what the master pointed out about the fury that had him in its grip, the samurai calmed down, sheathed his sword, and bowed, thanking the monk for the insight.
"And that,"said the monk "is heaven."
