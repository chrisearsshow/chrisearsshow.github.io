              <h1>#67. The Whole Brain Child Part 3.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The next two strategies for a whole brain child are about memories.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Memories! Isn’t there a song about that? What’s that song again?
<p>C: Yeah, I’ve tried looking for it but can’t seem to find it. Which brings up the point that memories are fuzzy. We tend to think of our brain as a mental file cabinet when it’s more of an association machine. Every time we recall a memory, we link it with something else in our brain. And each retrieval alters the memory.
<p>VOJ: Wait, doesn’t that make our memories unreliable?
<p>C: Exactly. The authors call it historical fiction. 
<p>VOJ: What’s that got to do with children?
<p>C: Sometimes when an overwhelming event happens, the memory of it remains dis-integrated. Which means we can’t make sense of what happened. So it stays stuck in our brain causing us to be reactive but we don’t know why. The idea is to help children get unstuck.
<p>VOJ: By letting them watch lots of television?
<p>C: You’re actually not that far off if you mean the television of the mind. The whole brain strategy is to replay memories like it’s a television show.
<p>VOJ: Even painful ones? That sounds terrible.
<p>C: Start at the end or at a part where everything is okay. Fast forward, rewind or pause at painful parts. The idea is to take some time to talk it out and integrate it. It’s a process but it’ll help release any irrational fears.
<p>VOJ: That doesn’t sound like a fun time.
<p>C: You don’t have to do it all the time. And it doesn’t have to be only painful memories. The other brain strategy is to help the child practice memory recall on their own. Like journaling or drawing. Integration doesn’t only have to happen when you’re around.
<p>VOJ: The song is yesterday! Not memories! Yesterday!
<p>C: Can’t believe you remembered it. We’ve been humming it all day.
<p>VOJ: Yay, memory! Here’s a quick story. 
One day, a young man takes a trip out West and comes across a little Native American village. He decides, what the heck, he'll stop and look around. One of the Native women, seeing that he's not from around, tells the man he should visit the Chief, who she says has the longest and best memory in the world. So the man decides to go visit the Chief and asks: "So I hear you have the greatest memory in the world." The Chief answers "I do. I can remember every single detail of my entire life." The man figures he should test this, and asks the Chief "What did you have for breakfast on April the 27th, 1959?" After stopping to think for a second, the chief answers "two eggs." Satisfied, the man says goodbye to the Chief and eventually leaves the village. Twenty years later, the man takes another trip out West and comes across the same village. He's amazed when he notices the Chief, still alive after all these years. The man, stops and says hello, so he raises his hand and says, "How" and the Chief replies "fried."`
