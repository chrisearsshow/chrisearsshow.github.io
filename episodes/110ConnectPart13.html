              <h1>#110. Connect Part 13.</h1>
							 <p>Chris: Alright folks this is our last episode and we'll be wrapping up the book. Chapter 14 is about boundaries and expectations.
<p>Other Voice: Like the expectation that you release an episode every week.
<p>C: Right. We missed last week. Partly due to time management and partly due to my readiness to move on to other projects. But back to chapter 14, which is about how everyone carries expectations of what’s okay to ask at different stages of a relationship.
<p>OV: Like the "are we exclusive?" talk. Or the "can you pick me up at the airport" stage of the relationship.
<p>C: Exactly. And with the request, there may come a point when you need to draw a line in the sand, even knowing that it could damage an important relationship. But at the same time, a true friend doesn’t tell you what you want to hear, they tell you what they believe is best for you. 
<p>OV: Sure. That's why we have lots of friends.
<p>C: Yeah, we're not great at expressing expectations. The other part of chapter 14 is how boundaries can help make a relationship healthier. Just because you have an exceptional relationship with someone, that doesn’t mean you’re invited into every aspect of their life. The overall point is to be explicit in your expectations and boundaries. 
<p>OV: Why not just go with the flow?
<p>C: Because not communicating means you're just guessing about each other's needs. The idea is to provide information but not as means to control the other person.
<p>OV: What happens when you set expectations and boundaries and just end up arguing?
<p>C: That brings us to Chapter 15 which is about entangled issues. These issues usually raise deeply personal feelings in both people. For example, if you just learned that your mother has a terminal illness, but your friend has suddenly lost a parent, do you bring it up? 
<p>OV: My advice is to make friends with younger people.
<p>C: Or maybe a healthier option is to say, “I’m sorry; I really want to help, but this is just too painful for me.”
<p>OV: So setting a boundary. That's just a repeat of chapter 14.
<p>C: Right. It builds on that by pointing out that even in exceptional relationships, not every issue can be resolved. The key is to be open about your needs, be concerned about the other person’s needs, and have that conversation without blame.
<p>OV: What if the relationship can't be exceptional?
<p>C: That's chapter 16. Not all your relationships are going to be exceptional. One of the potential downsides of focusing on exceptional relationships is devaluing any connection that doesn’t reach that level. Sometimes it’s necessary to simply be grateful for what’s been achieved. You get different needs from different people. 
<p>OV: So don't quit Facebook yet.
<p>C: Sure. That old high school sweetheart still might find you. But back to chapter 16, sometimes more meaningful relationships don’t develop. It might be that as you and the other person learn more about each other, you discover your views are so different that the effort involved in bridging them is simply too much work. Or perhaps you don’t have enough in
common and the costs of building a serious relationship don’t outweigh the benefits.
<p>OV: Are you breaking up with me?
<p>C: Well, this is our last time together. The point is that sometimes we just need to accept others for who they are. There is a danger that the harder we push, the more we risk alienating the other person. Holding desires too tightly can squeeze the life out of a relationship. Instead, sometimes meeting the other person where they are increases the chance they’ll join the journey at a later time.
<p>OV: I think we should see other people.
<p>C: Sounds good. Two more concepts before we finish up. The first is Kintsugi, or “golden repair,” a Japanese art form for fixing broken pottery. Lacquer mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum is applied in such a way as to highlight the breaks while also serving the
practical purpose of mending the pot. It is also a philosophy; if an object has been damaged, then it has a history that should be celebrated rather than hidden, covered up, or discarded.
<p>OV: Sound like it's time to go break something. 
<p>C: And lastly, exceptional relationships is when people who you care about accept you, in all of your flawed humanness. Only then have you narrowed the gap between how others
see you and how you see yourself. Their acceptance helps you accept yourself. And that self-acceptance then allows you to develop an internal compass that keeps you centered. 
<p>OV: Last joke of this podcast! What do you call a crocodile with a map and a compass? A navigator.
<p>C: Alright folks, it's been a pleasure making this podcast. Thank you for listening. If you ever want to get in touch, please email me at chrisearsshow@gmail.com.
