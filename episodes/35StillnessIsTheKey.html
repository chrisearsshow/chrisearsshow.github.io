              <h1>#35. Stillness Is The Key.</h1>
							  <p>Voice Of Judgement: What book are we talking about?
<p>Chris: Stillness is the Key.
<p>VOJ: Who’s it by?
<p>C: Ryan Holiday.
<p>VOJ: Hey, it’s Mr. “Stoic”, aka Mr. “Not a holiday”. 
<p>C: Yup. And like his other books he draws from various religions and philosophies and finds the theme of stillness.  
<p>VOJ: Like which religions?
<p>C: Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, the Greeks...
<p>VOJ: [Interrupting] Okay, okay, so all of them.
<p>C: Yeah. The author’s argument is that to do anything well, you need to cultivate stillness in the mind, spirit and body.
<p>VOJ: How do you do that?
<p>C: The author suggests several ideas for each domain. For the mind, it’s about limiting your inputs, journaling, cultivating silence and letting go.
<p>VOJ: If you let go then how does anything get done?
<p>C: The tendency is for us to approach things with an outcome or goal. Like in archery, we all want to hit the bullseye. What trips us up is that we aim too intensely and use too much willful will. Which leads us to missing the target and neglecting the process.
<p>VOJ: So how do we not be obsessed with the outcome?
<p>C: Awa Kenzo, an archery master, would have his students spend months firing arrows in to a hay bale, just a few feet in front of them.  Only when they fully surrendered and detached themselves from aiming, were they allowed targets. The idea is to get lost in the process. That way they could be present, empty and open to learning. 
<p>VOJ: kay, so how about the spirit?
<p>C: A few of Holiday’s suggestions are healing the inner child, being in a space of enough, bathing in beauty and conquering your anger. 
<p>VOJ: How do you be in a space of enough?
<p>C: That’s a tough one. Even the greats struggled with this. Billie Jean King, a tennis legend who’s won 39 Grand Slam titles, spoke about how the mentality that gets an athlete to the top often prevents them from enjoying the thing they worked so hard for. The need for progress can be the enemy of enjoying the process.
<p>VOJ: So how do you enjoy the process? 
<p>C: By seeing what you already have, what you’ve always had. The author quotes Thomas Traherne, a poet and theologian. “To have blessings and to prize them is to be in Heaven; to have them and not to prize them is to be in Hell.”
<p>VOJ: Man, you’re quoting a lot of people.
<p>C: Yeah, you can do the last one to close out the show.
<p>VOJ: Yay! Okay, final part. How do you find stillness in the body?
<p>C: Holiday suggests saying no, taking a walk, getting rid of stuff and building a routine.
<p>VOJ: But routine is boring.
<p>C: The author argues that done enough times, done with sincerity and feeling, routine becomes ritual. The regularity of it — the daily cadence — creates a deep and meaningful experience.
<p>VOJ: Okay! To break routine I will now close out the show! 
<p>C: Go for it.
<p>VOJ: “All of humanity’s problems,” Blaise Pascal said in 1654, “stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.”
<p>C: Thank you for closing out the show.
<p>VOJ: Does talking to ourselves count as stillness?
<p>C: I don’t know. Maybe it’s like journaling?
<p>VOJ: Are we’re going mad?
<p>C: Like a personality disorder?
<p>VOJ: Yeah.
<p>C: I don’t know. Do we like each other?
<p>VOJ: I think so.
<p>C: Meh, then we should be fine.
