              <h1>#66. The Whole Brain Child Part 2.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: In the last episode we talked about the logical left brain and emotional right brain. In this episode, we’re going talk about the upstairs and downstairs brain.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: It’s like we’re building a house! Next week we’re going to have a swimming pool brain!
<p>C: Sounds fun. So the downstairs brain includes the brain stem and limbic region, which is the area from the top of your neck to the bridge of your nose. It’s responsible for basic functions (like breathing and
blinking), for innate reactions and impulses (like fight and flight),
and for strong emotions (like anger and fear).
<p>VOJ: It keeps us alive!
<p>C: That’s right. And the upstairs brain is made up of the
cerebral cortex (the top outer layer) and the middle prefrontal
cortex (the part directly
behind your forehead). It’s in charge of sound decision making and planning, control over emotions and body, self-understanding, empathy, and morality.
<p>VOJ: It keeps us alive for way longer!
<p>C: Hopefully! And as usual the name of the game is integration of the downstairs and upstairs. We want both parts working together. 
<p>VOJ: Sounds easy. Just use the stairs. Bwahaha!
<p>C: Well, the trouble is we’re born with the downstairs brain fully built but the upstairs brain doesn’t get finished until we’re 25 years old. 
<p>VOJ: What! Our brain house takes forever to finish.
<p>C: Exactly. Which explains why children get trapped downstairs so easily. They throw tantrums or get paralyzed from fear and make bad decisions.
<p>VOJ: So how to get untrapped?
<p>C: The authors give us three strategies. The first is to appeal to the upstairs brain. For example, if the kid is throwing a tantrum about not eating, ask them what would be a fair amount to eat. That might bring the upstairs brain in to negotiate.
<p>VOJ: What if that doesn’t work?
<p>C: Sometimes negotiation isn’t possible and that’s okay. There will be plenty of future opportunities to appeal to the upstairs brain. In the meantime, we can apply the second strategy which is helping the child exercise their upstairs brain. For example, give the child chances to practice decision making. Or teach them a breathing practice to calm themself. 
<p>VOJ: It’s like we’re raising the Dalai Lama.
<p>C: Exactly. We can ask them questions about self understanding, empathy and morality. 
<p>VOJ: And give them a razor to shave their head!
<p>C: Sure, if they want to look like the Last Airbender. Okay, the third strategy is to move the body to avoid losing the mind. Basically exercise to feel better and get out from under the downstairs brain.
<p>VOJ: Let’s go for a swim!
<p>C: That works. We can practice our breathing.
<p>VOJ: Ugh, it’s always upstairs brain with you.
