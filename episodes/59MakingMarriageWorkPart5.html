              <h1>#59. Making Marriage Work Part 5.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Principle 4 is about letting your partner influence you and yielding to your partner.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: No sir! I will not yield the floor!
<p>C: Point of order! The principle comes back to the idea of emotional attunement and how yielding is part of that.
<p>VOJ: So just do whatever the other person says?
<p>C: Maybe look at it as shared decision making that combines the wisdom of both partners. 
<p>VOJ: What happens if the partners want different things?
<p>C: Gottman talks about knowing the difference between what conflict is solvable and what conflict is perpetual.
<p>VOJ: How do you know?
<p>C: Solvable is usually less gut wrenching and situational, as in it doesn’t apply to all areas of their life. Like if one partner is recently late in the mornings but only in the mornings and it’s a new thing. 
<p>VOJ: That reminds of a joke -
A small town police officer stops a driver speeding through. The driver says, “Look I can explain…” The police officer cuts him off, “The Chief wants me to put anyone going thirty over the limit in jail. But you’re lucky, the chief will be in a good mood today because he’s at his daughter's wedding. The driver replies, "Probably not. I'm the groom."
