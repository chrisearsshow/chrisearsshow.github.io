              <h1>#33. The Truth (Part 2).</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today, we’re continuing with the book, The Truth by Neil Strauss, which covers sex addiction, trauma and relationships. In the last episode, we talked about the author’s experience in rehab.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Since we’re doing a second episode, it probably means rehab didn’t fix him. 
<p>C: Right. So he goes back to his girlfriend but slips up by texting another woman. 
<p>VOJ: Man, rehab is useless.
<p>C: I wouldn’t say that. The author’s wise friend suggests going into sex addiction recovery all the way for ninety days. And so the author does. For ten months, he does one on one therapy, group therapy, neurofeedback, supplements and workbooks.
<p>VOJ: The end.
<p>C: Unfortunately not. Because after all that he’s still miserable. So he consults another expert, Helen Fisher, who’s a researcher on the science of relationships.
<p>VOJ: Does she fix him?
<p>C: No, but she shares some interesting insights. Like that humans have three different primary brain systems for mating: one for sex, another
for romantic love, and a third for deep attachment. After the initial intensity
of a new relationship, our romance and sex drives often swing toward other
people, while our attachment drive remains connected to our primary partner.
<p>VOJ: So it’s normal to cheat!
<p>C: Perhaps. Fisher suggests the solution
is for couples to do novel and exciting things together (to release dopamine and
get the romance rush), make love regularly (to release oxytocin and sexually
bond), cut themselves off from cheating opportunities, and, in general, make sure
their partners are “continually thrilling” enough to keep all three drives
humming.
<p>VOJ: The sounds like a lot of work. 
<p>C: The author felt the same way and started questioning the idea of monogamy and the marriage tradition. Here’s where a couple more experts chimed in.
<p>VOJ: So many experts?!
<p>C: That’s why we broke this book up in to two parts. The first expert is Professor Peter J. Richerson, who says, “If it were all genetic, if humans just by nature mated for life and there were
a very tight pair-bond, then we wouldn’t
need all these marriage customs.”
<p>VOJ: And expensive weddings.
<p>C: Right. Speaking of money, the historian Stephanie Coontz, the author of “Marriage, a
History”, says that the tradition was never even supposed to be about intimacy.
For the majority of its history, marriage was an economic and political
institution, mostly about merging resources, forming alliances, or creating a
bloodline for inheritance... Not until the late eighteenth century did
people marry for love. And it took until the late twentieth century for marriage to
start becoming an intimate partnership rather than a patriarchal institution.
<p>VOJ: That’s a lot of work for a marriage to do. 
<p>C: Yes and it’s still evolving. Which led the author to think about open relationships and polyamory. 
<p>VOJ: With his girlfriend?
<p>C: No, he breaks up with her first before he goes exploring.
<p>VOJ: Well, at least he has the decency to do that. And what does he find?
<p>C: A lot. He tries open relationships. He goes to Tantric pujas, polyamory conferences and swinging parties.  Then he builds his own poly pod which fails. Then he tries a commune which fails. It led to a mix of great sex, terrible sex, being super stressed out, being on both sides of insane jealousy and possessiveness, and almost getting murdered by an axe. 
<p>VOJ: What?!
<p>C: Yeah, that was the other half of the book.
<p>VOJ: How does he almost get murdered?
<p>C: Not surprisingly, by a jealous boyfriend.
<p>VOJ: So does he find a relationship that worked for him?
<p>C: No, he learned that polyamory was in a lot of ways even less freeing than monogamy, when you take in to account everyone’s relationships. Let’s say there’s 4 people in a poly pod, that’s 6 relationships to worry about. 5 people becomes 10 relationships.
<p>VOJ: That gets complicated fast. 
<p>C: Exactly. Just going to a party together means talking about the protocol before hand and then checking in on each other on a regular basis.
<p>VOJ: Just like rehab!
<p>C: Yup. And in open relationships, you have to learn compersion. Which is being happy for your partner when they have another lover.
<p>VOJ: So not just not jealous but happy for them?
<p>C: Yeah. So after all that craziness, he goes back to his therapist. She suggests something he hadn’t tried before which is anhedonia.
<p>VOJ: What’s that?
<p>C: The dark place of not feeling, not experiencing joy or pleasure.
<p>VOJ: Why would that be a good idea?
<p>C: It’s a way to detox from the intensity of the crazy relationships, and to return to homeostasis and have clarity on who he is.
<p>VOJ: How do you get to anhedonia?
<p>C: Basically the author goes even more hardcore in to his feelings by changing his lifestyle completely. Anything related to sex or romantic relationships he eliminates from his life. And lots and lots of therapy. 
<p>VOJ: Sounds miserable.
<p>C: It is. But the wise friend reminds the author that it’s important for the feelings to come to the surface to be worked on. Thankfully the hard work pays off and he gets to a place of anhedonia. He gets to an absence of feeling.
<p>VOJ: Then what? 
<p>C: The author then learns to love and parent himself. He learns he was never actually pursuing sexual freedom but control, power, and self-worth.
<p>VOJ: That’s a good lesson.
<p>C: Right? The fairy tale ending is that after all that healing he reaches out to the girlfriend from the beginning and marries her. 
<p>VOJ: Aww. That is fairy tale.
<p>C: Yeah. So to close, here’s a quote:
<p>“The opposite of fear is not joy. It is acceptance.”
