              <h1>#88. Getting Past Your Past Part 8.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 8 provides several relationship tips. The first is knowing what behaviors or situations set you off. For example, if someone is chronically late and that drives you up the wall, then that’s good for your partner to know.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: Like to never, ever, ever, ever be late releasing a podcast episode.
                <p>C: Right. We’re not a great example of punctuality. On the flip side, it’s also good for you to know what the triggers are for your partner.
                <p>VOJ: My trigger is when you don’t do whatever I say.
                <p>C: And that’s why we’re single. Another tip that ties into the first, is that when arguments get emotionally intense to have a plan. An example is for the both of you to go on a “Time-Out”, cool off, and then come back to discuss the issue in a non-emotional manner.
                <p>VOJ: I’m not mad! This is just how I whisper!
                <p>C: A third tip is to not be embarrassed or afraid to ask for help. We’re not born knowing how to build emotionally healthy relationships and how to work through difficulties. We’re supposed to learn this from our parents, but they can’t teach us what they didn’t know themselves.
                <p>VOJ: Good thing we were raised by wolves.
                <p>C: The fourth tip is to be generous. Like taking notice and offering time, assistance, a kind word, or forgiveness for a minor slight. It involves reaching inside of ourselves to offer the best of what we have to the people we love. But to offer this, we also need to take care of ourselves.
                <p>VOJ: Or just give money. Money’s good too.
                <p>C: The fifth and final tip is to try to stay open. Sometimes when there’s a pattern of conflict, one starts to “shut down” and “close off” from a partner. It’s like placing yourself in a steel box to prevent further hurt. But the problem with these boxes is that, while they may keep you “safe,” they also isolate you and wall off any possibility for change. Sometimes it’s a way to punish a partner, but it’s also self-punishing, as you can feel numb, withdrawn, and depressed.
                <p>VOJ: I used to have an open mind but my brains kept falling out. Do you know why you should stop to purchase a clock when you're running late?
                <p>C: Why?
                <p>VOJ: That way, you buy time! Yesterday I was late to the cannibal party. 
                <p>C: So what happened?
                <p>VOJ: They gave me the cold shoulder.
                <p>C: Why do we do this to ourselves?
                <p>VOJ: We should get a dog and call it Rolex. 
                <p>C: No.
                <p>VOJ: Come on! That way we have a watchdog!
                <p>C: Why do we like these dad jokes so much?!
