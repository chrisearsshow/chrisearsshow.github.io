              <h1>#109. Connect Part 12.</h1>
							 <p>Chris: Chapter 13 starts a new section of the book, which is about making a relationship exceptional.
<p>Other Voice: I thought we were already doing that with the first part of the book?
<p>C: The first part was more about creating norms in the relationship. Like how to raise issues, how to express needs, and how to work on solving problems.
<p>OV: That sounds pretty exceptional to me.
<p>C: You’ll know you’ve reached exceptional when you don’t have to hold back significant parts of yourself that are relevant to the relationship, nor does the other person. It’s when you can easily say that you’re feeling uncertain or confused about what is going on with the other person and with you so that you can talk about it. It’s when you can deal with major issues, even though it feels scary.
<p>OV: So the way to exceptional is scary? People should get married in war zones.
<p>C: That's what this chapter is about - how to resolve contentious issues.
<p>OV: By reading a list of what not to do and have the listener tune out!
<p>C: You got it. Here are the most common traps to avoid:
<ul>
<li>Rushing to judgment
<li>Either/or thinking
<li>Arguing about solutions rather than focusing on needs
<li>Treating opinions as facts
<li>Confusing “trials” with final decisions
<li>Undervaluing personal needs
<li>Not taking into account personal styles
<li>Deciding who implements what
</ul>
<p>OV: Welcome to the "put you to sleep" podcast!
<p>C: The important thing is to frame the problem as a problem for both people and not just one or the other.
<p>OV: What happens if the problem never gets resolved?
<p>C: When either or both parties are resistant to giving up on some topic, deep historical issues are often at play. Then the conversation should be given the time and space for these issues to surface and be explored. Awareness of ways in which someone is influenced by their past can prevent labeling them prematurely.
<p>OV: Sounds like you just end up playing therapist for each other.
<p>C: As you put the puzzle pieces of problem-solving in place, paying attention to different time frames—present, past, and future is important. The present identifies sources of dissatisfaction and unmet needs. The past illustrates what’s been lost and informs how you’ve gotten to where you are. The future keeps you focused on where each of you wants to end up and can break the logjam of mutual recriminations. Often the discussion has to shuttle back and forth among these different time periods to get the best outcome.
<p>OV: So talk about everything.
<p>C: It’s like the proverbial peeling of the onion. The outer skin makes it hard to find out what’s going on. Then we discover the presenting issue, and beneath that, the even more personal, vulnerable issues.
<p>OV: I hate the onion analogy.
<p>C: Why's that?
<p>OV: Because when we peel off our protective layers, we end up crying.
<p>C: It's probably what actually happens.
<p>OV: What do you call an onion that keeps on jumping up and down? 
<p>C: What?
<p>OV: A spring onion! What is the name of the horse that a knight onion rides? 
<p>C: What's a knight onion?
<p>OV: Like the guys who worked for King Arthur but are also onions. What do they ride?
<p>C: They ride horses?
<p>OV: Nope, they ride scallions!
