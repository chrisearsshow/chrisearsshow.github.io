                <h1>#85. Getting Past Your Past Part 5.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 5 talks about how unprocessed memories affect attachment styles. Attachment styles help explain why some people have a negative sense of “self” and is why they can’t seem to find a sense of satisfaction and well-being in life.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: What are attachment styles?
                <p>Chris: The bond you have with your primary caregivers and their responsiveness or attunement to your needs. Unfortunately about 35% of the time, there are misattunements leading to insecure attachment styles.
                <p>VOJ: What does that have to do with unprocessed memories?
                <p>Chris: For example, pregnancy and child birth can be a difficult and complicated process. A mother may be constantly nauseated and vomit several times a day through most of the nine months. And the delivery can be a long, painful labor that requires an emergency c-section. When a mother doesn’t have the time to process those experiences, it can make it challenging for the mother to bond with the child.
                <p>VOJ: So then what?
                <p>Chris: The mother is less responsive to the child’s needs. That’s when the child feels unloved and internalizes the belief that there’s something wrong with them. 
                <p>VOJ: Man, that sucks.
                <p>Chris: Yeah, there can also be a number of unfortunate circumstances that affect the primary caregivers’ lives that have nothing to do with the child. Like an insecure attachment style could be passed on from the previous generation. Thankfully negative insecure attachment styles can be reversed through positive experiences with teachers, coaches, peers and
                therapy.
                <p>VOJ: Sounds like you’re selling me on therapy.
                <p>Chris: Maybe. Another option is an exercise called Expanding The Safety Net. It’s about strengthening your access to good memories. Write down a sentence that
                describes a positive memory where you felt a sense of well-being,
                accomplishment or joy. Then hold that memory in mind and notice where
                you feel it in your body. Enjoy it and and then let it go. Repeat a few times.
                <p>VOJ: So it’s like Safe Calm Place but Happy Place.
                <p>Chris: Right. It’s also a good gauge of your general mood. If you’re depressed, it’ll be harder for you to access your good memories.
                <p>VOJ: Okay, here’s a story to close: A man is in court. The judge says,"On the 3rd of August you are accused of killing your wife by beating her to death with a hammer, how do you plead?"
                "Guilty", says the man. At this point another man at the back of the court stands up and shouts "You dirty rat!" The judge asks the man to sit down and to refrain from making any noise.
                The judge continues "..... and that also on the 17th of September you are accused of killing your son by beating him to death with a hammer, how do you plead"? 
                "Guilty", said the accused.
                Again the same man at the back stands up and shouts even louder, "You dirty rotten stinking rat!" At this point the judge calls that man to the bench and says, "I’ve already asked you to be quiet. If you continue with these outbursts, I will have to charge you with contempt of court. I can understand your feelings, but what is your relationship to the accused?" He replies "He’s my next door neighbor". The judge replies, "Okay, I can understand your feelings then, but you must refrain from any comments". The man replies "NO, your Honor, you don't understand. Twice I asked if I could borrow a hammer, and BOTH TIMES he said he didn't have one!"
