              <h1>#58. Making Marriage Work Part 4.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The first principle of making a marriage work is to enhance your love maps.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Sounds dirty.
<p>C: Not physical maps. Mental maps. The love map is all the relevant information about your partner’s life. It’s about making cognitive space for your partner.
<p>VOJ: Why is that helpful?
<p>C: Well, according to the research sixty-seven percent of newly weds had a huge drop in marital satisfaction the first time they became parents. But the remaining 33 percent did not experience this decline — about half of them saw their marriages improve.
What separated these two groups? The couples whose marriages thrived after the birth had detailed love maps of each other.
<p>VOJ: How detailed?
<p>C: Like they remember the major events in each other’s history, and they keep updating their information as the facts
and feelings of their spouse’s world change. When she orders him a salad, she
knows what kind of dressing he likes. If she works late, he’ll think to record
her favorite TV show. He could tell you how she’s feeling about her boss and
exactly how to get to her office from the elevator. He knows that religion is
important to her but that deep down she has doubts. She knows that he fears
being too much like his father and considers himself a “free spirit.” They
know each other’s life goals, worries, and hopes.
<p>VOJ: Oh my god, so much to remember.
<p>C: And there’s more. The second principle is to nurture your fondness and admiration.
<p>VOJ: There is nothing positive about you that I appreciate.
<p>C: That would be the opposite of that principle.
<p>VOJ: So you want me to be fake it?
<p>C: Actually it’s not phony but more realistic. Couples were asked to tally their positive interactions after being observed. When
the researchers compared the scores the couple gave themselves with those of
the objective observers, they discovered that couples who described themselves
as unhappily married only noticed half of the positive interactions that
actually occurred. Because they were so used to tuning in to their partner’s
mistakes, they each missed a full 50 percent of their partner’s positive actions.
<p>VOJ: Fine. You’re not a dummmy.
<p>C: There you go. The third principle is turn toward each other instead of away. A simple example is when you’re in the supermarket aisle and your partner asks, “Are
we out of butter?” You answer, “I don’t know. Let me go get some just in
case,” instead of shrugging apathetically.
<p>VOJ: I’m shrugging right now.
<p>C: That would be considered a failed bid. A bid is a chance to attune to each other. Bids can be as minor as asking for a backrub or as significant as
seeking help in carrying the burden when an aging parent is ill. In
the six-year follow-up with the newlyweds, they found that couples who remained
married had turned toward their partner’s bids an average of 86 percent of the
time in the Love Lab, while those who ended up divorced had averaged only
33 percent.
<p>VOJ: That reminds me of this joke:
When people hear that my grandpa and grandma just celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary, they inevitably ask them the secret to their long, successful marriage. In response, grandpa will smile sweetly, look adoringly at grandma, and explain, “We both love me.”
