              <h1>#71. No Drama Discipline Part 2.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 2 of No Drama Discipline covers the three Brain C’s.
                <ol>
                <li>The brain is changing
                <li>The brain is changeable
                <li>The brain is complex
                </ol>
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: We covered this in the last book!
                <p>C: It’s similar but worth going over again. For example, knowing that the brain is changeable means that it can be molded intentionally by experience. Also, remembering that the brain is complex, helps us understand that appealing to one part of the brain will get one result and appealing to another part of the brain can give us a completely different result.
                <p>VOJ: It’s like the person has a bunch of different people in one head.
                <p>C: That’s one way to look at it. Coming back to brain integration, we want all those different people to work together.
                <p>VOJ: Okay. How?
                <p>C: One of the ways is by setting limits. The absence of limits and boundaries is actually quite stressful, making kids more reactive. Limits help children discover predictability and safety in an otherwise chaotic world.
                <p>VOJ: So just say no.
                <p>C: Right. But not with anger or negative comments. That doesn’t help with their emotional regulation and can lead to toxic shame. 
                <p>VOJ: Okay, so no shame.
                <p>C: Actually, a sense of shame is good. Feeling bad about their behavior means they recognize a limit and their behavior should change. What we don’t want is the extreme where they internalize the idea that there’s something fundamentally flawed about them self.   
                <p>VOJ: Shame good. Toxic shame bad. But how do you avoid it?
                <p>C: One approach is instead of an outright no, is to say yes with a condition. “Yes, the bath can be later” or “Yes, we’ll read another story, but we’ll need to do it tomorrow.”
                <p>VOJ: It still doesn’t sound easy.
                <p>C: The authors acknowledge that there’s a tension and discomfort when setting a limit. But misbehavior gives us valuable information that we might not otherwise get. A simple reframe is that by setting a limit, it gives us a chance to build their brain through what hopefully is a meaningful experience.
                <p>VOJ: Okay. It reminds me of what my doctor told me. He said, “Don’t eat anything fatty.”  I asked him, “What, like bacon and cheeseburgers?” He replied, “No, fatty. Don’t eat anything.” 
                <p>C: Oh man, you need a better doctor.
