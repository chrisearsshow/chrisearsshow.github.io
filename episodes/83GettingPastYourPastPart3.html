             <h1>#83. Getting Past Your Past Part 3.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 3 provides several exercises. They’re called the Safe/Calm Place, Breathing Shift, Butterfly Hug, Cartoon Character and Water Hose.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: So many!
                <p>C: Exactly. So let’s get started. Safe/Calm Place starts with finding a positive image or experience that you have in your memory. Notice the colors and how you feel. See if there’s a single word that goes with that feeling. Close your eyes, bring that image to your mind, notice your feelings and say the word in your mind.
                <p>VOJ: That’s it?
                <p>C: Yup. Each time will take about a minute. Try doing it for five minutes.
                <p>VOJ: That doesn’t seem so bad.
                <p>C: Yeah. Which brings us to the next exercise, Breathing Shift. While doing Safe/Calm Place, notice your breath and how it changes. Place your hand over your stomach or chest to feel in to it. Try to remember this breathing pattern.
                <p>VOJ: I feel like you’re going to pop out of a closet and scare me now.
                <p>C: Maybe not that extreme but the idea is similar. When disturbing memories come up, see if you can do Safe/Calm Place and Breathing Shift.
                <p>VOJ: What’s the Butterfly Hug?
                <p>C: This exercise adds bilateral stimulation to Safe/Calm Place to increase the positive feelings. Put your hands on your thighs and tap one thigh then the other slowly back and forth. Go back and forth four to six times and it should take about five seconds.
                <p>VOJ: That’s still not a Butterfly Hug.
                <p>C: Ah yeah. It’s the same side to side tapping but with your arms crossed in front of your chest. Your right hand is on your left shoulder and your left hand is on your right. Again, bring up Safe/Calm Place while you do it.
                <p>VOJ: What if that doesn’t work?
                <p>C: If the bilateral stimulation helps, then use it daily. If not, do Safe/Calm Place without it.
                <p>VOJ: How about Cartoon Character?
                <p>C: This one is about negative self talk. Close your eyes and bring up that critical
                voice and notice how your body changes. Then make that voice
                in your head sound like a cartoon character and notice what
                happens.
                <p>VOJ: That’s how we end up with a podcast talking to ourselves.
                <p>C: Right. Okay and the final exercise to cover is Water Hose. This one is about bringing up a disturbing memory and noticing how you feel. Then imagine washing that image away with a high-pressure water hose and notice how you feel again. 
                <p>VOJ: Why not just do that one instead of all the others?
                <p>C: I don’t know. Maybe it doesn’t work as well? The point of all these exercises is to help you remember that you can be in control of your body and mind.
                <p>VOJ: Speaking of exercise. Do you know what Jesus’s favorite exercise was?
                <p>C: What?
                <p>VOJ: Crossfit!
                <p>C: Oh god.
                <p>VOJ: No, God’s son. Do you know what a ghost’s favorite exercise is?
                <p>C: I don’t want to know.
                <p>VOJ: Dead Lifts!
                <p>C: Stop.
                <p>VOJ: Do you know what a pirate's favorite exercise is?
                <p>C: Please stop.
                <p>VOJ: The plank! 
                <p>C: Editing this is going to take forever!
