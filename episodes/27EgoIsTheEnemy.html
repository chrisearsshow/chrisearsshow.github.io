              <h1>#27. Ego is the Enemy.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: "Ego is the enemy" is the book we're talking about today.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: I thought waffles were our friend.
<p>C: You're thinking about eggos. I'm talking about egos.
<p>VOJ: Igor? I don't know anyone called Igor.
<p>C: It's ego!
<p>VOJ: Echo? Are we podcasting from a cave?
<p>C: I hate you. 
<p>VOJ: And now you're my enemy.
<p>C: Well done. Okay, the book is by Ryan Holiday. And the basic idea is that we're our own worst enemy.
<p>VOJ: How's that?
<p>C: We sabotage ourselves when we think we're more important than we are.
<p>VOJ: How do we do that?
<p>C: Holiday talks about three phases of life. Aspiration, success and failure. In the aspiration phase, if we listen to our ego, we tend to get passionate and talk a lot about our dreams. The trouble is when we start believing our own marketing, the work doesn't get done.
<p>VOJ: Okay, how about the other two phases?
<p>C: In the success phase, ego leads us to entitlement, controlling behavior and paranoia. In the failure phase, ego leads us to becoming a passive, bitter victim who blames others. 
<p>VOJ: So what should we do instead?
<p>C: Practice tempering our ego with various strategies.
<p>VOJ: Like what?
<p>C: Like adopting a beginner mindset - to always being a student and learning. Or looking at yourself with a little distance and taking a sober account of your strengths and weaknesses. Or clearing the path for others and becoming a platform that raises up others.
<p>VOJ: That sounds like a lot of work.
<p>C: It is. But that's the point. The idea is to continually work and live with purpose. Not working to retire and live on the couch.
<p>VOJ: But then what do we get out of it?
<p>C: That leads us to the closing quote:
<p>"Your potential, the absolute best you’re capable of—that’s the metric to measure yourself against. Your standards are. Winning is not enough. People can get lucky and win. People can be assholes and win. Anyone can win. But not everyone is the best possible version of themselves.” 
<p>VOJ: This episode wasn't very fun.
<p>C: Well, the book is about stoicism.
<p>VOJ: I'm just saying if you're putting yourself in the comedy category.
<p>C: Well, you did do a bunch of jokes in the beginning.
<p>VOJ: His name is Holiday! And all he talks about is working. 
<p>C: Yeah, that is ironic.
<p>VOJ: Maybe he meant it as a joke.
<p>C: Maybe. You know we did the closing quote thirty seconds ago?
<p>VOJ: Oh yeah. Bye!!!
