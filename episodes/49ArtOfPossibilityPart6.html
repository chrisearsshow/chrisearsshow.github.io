              <h1>#49. The Art Of Possibility Part 6.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter Seven’s practice is about being present to the way things are, including our feelings about the way things are.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Nope.
<p>C: That’s fine.
<p>VOJ: Nope, never.
<p>C: And that’s an example of how resistance can lead to being stuck.
<p>VOJ: So how do I get unstuck?
<p>C: One trick is use the word “and” instead of “but”.
<p>VOJ: But I like using the word “but”.
<p>C: And that’s great. See how “and” helps us move along, while “but” stops the flow?
<p>VOJ: This is starting to feel like an improv class.
<p>C: Exactly. It’s “Yes and..” ing. And here are some other tools for being present to the way things are:
<ul>
<li>Clear the “shoulds”
<li>Close the exits
<li>Clear judgments
<li>Distinguish the physical reality from conceptual reality
</ul>
<p>VOJ: Clear the “shoulds” makes sense. What’s “Close the exits”?
<p>C: The exits are escape, denial and blame. When we have intense feelings we tend to look for exits. Being present with intense feelings is a muscle that’ll get stronger with practice.
<p>VOJ: How do you “clear judgments”?
<p>C: Here’s a story to demonstrate that and to close out the show: 
<p>There once was an old Zen farmer. Every day, the farmer used his horse to help work his fields and keep his farm healthy.
<p>But one day, the horse ran away. All the villagers came by and said, “We're so sorry to hear this. This is such bad luck.” 
<p>But the farmer responded, “Bad luck. Good luck. Who knows?” 
<p>The villagers were confused, but decided to ignore him. A few weeks went by and then one afternoon, while the farmer was working outside, he looked up and saw his horse running toward him. But the horse was not alone. The horse was returning to him with a whole herd of horses. So now the farmer had 10 horses to help work his fields.
<p>All the villagers came by to congratulate the farmer and said, “Wow! This is such good luck!”
<p>But the farmer responded, “Good luck. Bad luck. Who knows?
<p>A few weeks later, the farmer's son came over to visit and help his father work on the farm. While trying to tame one of the horses, the farmer’s son fell and broke his leg. 
<p>The villagers came by to commiserate and said, “How awful. This is such bad luck.” 
<p>Just as he did the first time, the farmer responded, “Bad luck. Good luck. Who knows?” 
<p>A month later, the farmer’s son was still recovering. He wasn’t able to walk or do any manual labor to help his father around the farm. 
<p>A regiment of the army came marching through town conscripting every able-bodied young man to join them. When the regiment came to the farmer’s house and saw the young boy's broken leg, they marched past and left him where he lay.
<p>Of course, all the villagers came by and said, “Amazing! This is such good luck. You're so fortunate.”
<p>And you know the farmer’s response by now…
<p>“Good luck. Bad luck. Who knows?”
<p>VOJ: He must be great at dinner parties.
<p>C: Who knows? Good luck…
<p>VOJ: Don’t you dare.
