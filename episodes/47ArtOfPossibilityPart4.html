              <h1>#47. The Art Of Possibility Part 4.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 5’s practice is “Leading from any chair.” In orchestras, where you sit usually shows how important you are. And as a conductor, Benjamin is usually considered the most important. But that changed when he realized that out of all the musicians, he’s the only one who doesn’t make a sound. 
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Sounds like he’s just bossy. Did he become less bossy?
<p>C: A lot of conductors are and yes, Benjamin became less bossy. Traditionally, a conductor is about bending the other musicians to his will and his interpretation of music. But then he changed how he saw his job. He realized that his actual job is to make the group lively and engaged. To enable the musicians to play the music as beautifully as they are capable. 
<p>VOJ: How is he supposed to do that?
<p>C: Benjamin starts by looking in to his musicians’ eyes and paying attention to their posture. Are they slumped in their chairs? He also leaves blank sheets of paper on their music stands, asking for any thoughts they might have. 
<p>VOJ: How did that go?
<p>C: At first, he was worried that he would only get criticism. But instead he received support and recognition. He also received incredibly insightful interpretations on the music. Which led to the idea of leading from any chair. 
<p>VOJ: Aren’t conductors supposed to know the most about music?
<p>C: Not always. Benjamin shares this story about Eugene Lehner, a violist who has decades of experience:
<p>One Friday,
when he was a guest coach at my Interpretation class, I raised this
issue; for the benefit of the class I asked him, “How can you bear to
play day after day in an orchestra led by conductors, many of whom
must know so much less than you?” In his habitual humility, he
sidestepped the compliment and then indicated that he did indeed
have something to say on the subject:
<p>One day, during my very first year playing with the orchestra, I
remember an occasion when Koussevitsky was conducting a Bach
piece and he seemed to be having some difficulty getting the results
he wanted—it simply wasn’t going right. Fortunately, his friend, the
great French pedagogue and conductor Nadia Boulanger, happened
to be in town and sitting in on the rehearsal, so Koussevitsky took
the opportunity to extricate himself from an awkward and
embarrassing situation by calling out to her, “Nadia, please, will you
come up here and conduct? I want to go to the back of the hall to
see how it sounds.” Mademoiselle Boulanger stepped up, made a
few comments to the musicians, and conducted the orchestra
through the passage without a hitch. 
<p>Ever since that time, in every
rehearsal, I have been waiting for the conductor to say, “Lehner, you
come up here and conduct, I want to go to the back of the hall to
hear how it sounds.” It is now forty-three years since this happened,
and it is less and less likely that I will be asked. However, in the
meantime, I haven’t had a single dull moment in a rehearsal, as I sit
wondering what I would say to the orchestra should I suddenly be
called upon to lead.
<p>VOJ: So you’re quoting a story from some one who’s also quoting a story?
<p>C: Yeah and we’re going to quote another story from Lehner to drive the point home about leading from any chair.
<p>The legendary Kolisch Quartet had the singular distinction of playing
its entire repertoire from memory, including the impossibly complex
modern works of Schoenberg, Webern, Bartok, and Berg. Eugene
Lehner was the violist for the quartet in the 1930s. Lehner’s stories
about their remarkable performances often included a hair-raising
moment when one player or another had a memory slip. Although he
relished the rapport that developed between them without the
encumbrance of a music stand, he admits there was hardly a concert
in which some mistake did not mar the performance. The alertness,
presence, and attention required of the players in every performance
is hard to fathom, but in one concert an event occurred that
surpassed their ordinary brinkmanship.
<p>In the middle of the slow movement of Beethoven’s String
Quartet op. 95, just before his big solo, Lehner suddenly had an
inexplicable memory lapse, in a place where his memory had never
failed him before. He literally blacked out. But the audience heard
Opus 95 as it was meant to be played, the viola solo sounding in all
its richness. Even the first violinist, Rudolph Kolisch, and cellist,
Bennar Heifetz, both with their eyes closed and deeply absorbed in
the music, were unaware that Lehner had dropped out. The second
violinist, Felix Khuner, was playing Lehner’s melody, coming in
without missing a beat at the viola’s designated entrance, the notes
perfectly in tune and voiced like a viola on an instrument tuned a fifth
higher. Lehner was stunned, and offstage after the performance
asked Khuner how he could have possibly known to play. Khuner
answered with a shrug: “I could see that your finger was poised over
the wrong string, so I knew you must have forgotten what came
next.”
