              <h1>#29. The Inner Game of Tennis.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: What book are we talking about today?
<p>Voice Of Judgement: The Inner Game of Tennis!
<p>C: And who is it by?
<p>VOJ: W. Timothy Gallwey!
<p>C: And what's it about?
<p>VOJ: Tennis?
<p>C: Yes. The author uses tennis as example of applying inner game and how it can be useful in other situations.
<p>VOJ: Why tennis?
<p>C: Gallwey is a tennis coach. Initially, he would teach the traditional way, giving explicit instructions like, "Grip the racket harder."  But his students would get mixed results. Gallwey was also a meditator. So he tried a different method of inviting his students to focus their awareness on their strokes as they were.
<p>VOJ: Did it work?
<p>C: It worked way faster. Their technique evolved naturally and self corrected. 
<p>VOJ: Why did it work?
<p>C: Gallwey's theory is that there two selves. Self 1 - the ego mind, the thinker. And Self 2 - the unconscious, the natural ability. Self 1 is the part that self criticizes and tries hard to “do it right.” It's also the part that gets in the way. 
<p>VOJ: So how do you get Self 1 out of the way?
<p>C: To retrain Self 1 with three new habits:
<ol>
<li>To observe with out judgement.
<li>To picture the desired outcome. 
<li>To trust yourself to let it happen.
</ol>
<p>VOJ: If you're observing with out judgment, how do you know you're doing it wrong?
<p>C: Let's say you're hitting the ball in to the net. Just observe - "Huh, interesting, I'm hitting the ball in to the net." But don't label it as wrong and berate yourself or try harder to hit it over the net. Judgment results in tightness. Which leads to self inteference.
<p>VOJ: So how do you get past self inteference?
<p>C: There's a couple of ways to do that. You could visualize hitting the ball over the net. The more specific the better. Use your other senses. Feel in to it. Or you could observe some one else and enage the senses and feeling that way.
<p>VOJ: And then you just let it happen?
<p>C: Yup! Right now, your body is already on its own, doing a remarkable dance of keeping you alive. It's pumping blood, absorbing oxygen, digesting food. Trust yourself. 
<p>VOJ: Then what?
<p>C: Then rinse and repeat. Gradually the new habit will take hold. It'll be an ongoing practice while you continually refocus your attention back from judgement. 
<p>VOJ: Why does the judgement happen?
<p>C: Because of attachment. We get caught up in thinking about the future and past, instead of living in the present.
<p>VOJ: Why do we do that?
<p>C: Because we live in an achievement-oriented society. Where the basic message is, "You are a good person and worthy of respect only if you do things successfully."
<p>VOJ: So let's leave society and live in solitary!
<p>C: Sure. That could work. It depends what game you're playing. You have to decide what obstacles are worth overcoming and developing the inner stability to handle the judgements and distractions.
<p>VOJ: That doesn't sound fun.
<p>C: Again, depends on the game. If you choose one that interests you, then focusing your attention will be easy. 
<p>VOJ: I'm interested in food right now.
<p>C: Alright, let go eat. Here's the closing quote:
<p>“When we plant a rose seed in the earth, we notice that it is small, but we do not criticize it as "rootless and stemless." We treat it as a seed, giving it the water and nourishment required of a seed. When it first shoots up out of the earth, we don't condemn it as immature and underdeveloped; nor do we criticize the buds for not being open when they appear. We stand in wonder at the process taking place and give the plant the care it needs at each stage of its development. The rose is a rose from the time it is a seed to the time it dies. Within it, at all times, it contains its whole potential. It seems to be constantly in the process of change; yet at each state, at each moment, it is perfectly all right as it is.” 
<p>VOJ: The book should have been called "The inner game of flowers."
<p>C: Alright silly, let's get some food.
