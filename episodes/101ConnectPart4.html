							 <p>Chris: Chapter 5 is about rebalancing a relationship.
<p>Other Voice: How do you know when it’s out of balance?
<p>C: There are a few indicators. It can be when one person in the relationship feels exploited or when both people are conflict avoidant or when there’s a large influence discrepancy.
<p>OV: How do you if you’re being exploited?
<p>C: All relationships have trade-offs, but for a relationship to be
sustainable, each person has to have enough of their needs met, and
each must give things up. Over time, the benefits have to exceed the
costs. As relationships develop and each person allows themselves to
be more fully known, the two of them can learn how to increase the
benefits and reduce the costs.
<p>OV: So how does a relationship get out of balance?
<p>C: Conditions change in all relationships—new work opportunities
arise, family members become sick, and people age. When
individuals become locked into past agreements, they run the risk
that their own growth, and the growth of their relationship, will stall. The best relationships continue to evolve as each person discovers new needs, seeks different benefits, and learns to deal with and let go of prior limitations. Problems arise, though, when people grow at
different rates and in different directions, producing strain on the
relationship. The danger is that one or both stop growing to avoid
conflict.
<p>OV: What if there’s a large power discrepancy?
<p>C: Something to pay attention to is how you might be giving away your power. Here are ten habits to stop:
<ol>
<li>Assuming that your needs are secondary to the other’s
<li>Not listening to your feelings
<li>Letting yourself be interrupted
<li>Backing down when someone disagrees with you
<li>Avoiding conflict—not disagreeing with the other, keeping
things nice
<li>Not giving feedback, assuming the problem is probably yours
<li>Being concerned about being liked/approved of and seeing
that as most important
<li>Minimizing the importance of your comments
<li>Not taking credit for your accomplishments
<li>Not pointing out a problem unless you have a solution
</ol>
<p>OV: That’s a lot of things that can go wrong.
<p>C: The single most limiting one is the fear of conflict — believing that
conflict is a sign of a flawed relationship and/or that once unleashed,
disagreements will escalate and permanently damage or even destroy
the relationship. Even though arguments are rarely pleasant and can escalate to
dangerous levels, sweeping problems under the rug can be just as
perilous. Not only do the issues rarely go away, but they can fester
and grow.
<p>OV: So how do you rebalance a relationship?
<p>C: It comes back to paying attention to emotions and knowing what you want and what the other wants. The relationship may also need a meta-level discussion. 
<p>OV: What’s that?
<p>C: Sometimes what’s needed is to temporarily
set aside the content of the disagreement to discuss what was
blocking the ability to communicate. To use an analogy, when you
drive your car from home to work, your goal is to arrive at the office
on time. But you also pay attention to how the car is operating. Do
the brakes seem weak, the steering loose? Is the engine periodically
sputtering? Ignoring those as you wobble down the road is not going
to end well, as you might not make it to work at all. 
<p>OV: So talking about why we can’t talk. 
<p>C: Exactly. If you don’t double down on commitment when conflicts arise,
you are less likely to have a good outcome, which then makes it
harder to commit further. Suddenly, you are in a negatively
reinforcing loop. On the other hand, the very act of demonstrating
commitment can begin an important positively reinforcing loop. The
more we commit and invest, the more rewarding the outcome is
likely to be, and the better the outcome, the easier it is to commit
more.
<p>OV: Talking about balancing relationships, my girlfriend caught me balancing on one leg on our first date and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was practicing. I wanted to start off our relationship on the right foot.
<p>C: That’s not the balance the book is talking about!
<p>OV: Well, my bank is really proud of me. They keep calling to tell me that I have an outstanding balance.
<p>C: Again, not the right balance.
<p>OV: Did you know the best scales are made in the Czech Republic? They employ a system of Czechs and balances.
<p>C: Stop with the balancing jokes!
