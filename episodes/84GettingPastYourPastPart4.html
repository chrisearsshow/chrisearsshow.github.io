              <h1>#84. Getting Past Your Past Part 4.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: In the last chapter we covered exercises like Safe Calm Place, Breathing Shift and Butterfly Hug. We’ll be using them again in this chapter, as we start looking at unprocessed memories. 
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: How do you find the ones that are unprocessed?
                <p>C: One way is to start with a recent event that’s bothering you. When you bring up that memory, notice what emotion comes with it. Do a body scan and see if it shows up somewhere in your body. 
                <p>VOJ: But how do you know it’s unprocessed?
                <p>C: On a scale of 0-10, where 0 is neutral and 10 is the most disturbing, evaluate that memory. If it’s 3 or higher, it’s probably not fully processed.
                <p>VOJ: What?! That could be a lot of memories.
                <p>C: There are generally about 10 to 20 unprocessed memories that are responsible for most of the pain and suffering in most of our lives.
                <p>VOJ: We’re going to be in therapy forever!
                <p>C: I think the idea is that since all the memories are linked, you delve in to earlier and earlier memories. Eventually you’ll see what your negative beliefs are.
                <p>VOJ: All my beliefs are negative. Traffic is bad. Sugar is bad. Everything is bad.
                <p>C: It’s more about beliefs about yourself. They usually fall under the categories of responsibility (like I did something wrong), or lack of safety (like I can’t trust anyone) or lack of control and power (like I can’t get what I want).
                <p>VOJ: So what do you do with those memories and negative beliefs?
                <p>C: For right now, it’s enough to just keep a written log of them and after each memory, to remember to use Safe Calm Place and Breathing Shift. 
                <p>VOJ: If we need a safe calm place, shouldn’t we just go to a library?
                <p>C: That could work.
                <p>VOJ: Do you how books stay warm in the libraries? 
                <p>C: How?
                <p>VOJ: They wear book jackets. What is one life advice you can expect from a librarian? 
                <p>C: Read a book?
                <p>VOJ: You need to believe in your shelf.
                <p>C: I can’t believe people listen to this podcast.
                <p>VOJ: A drunk man goes into a library and shouts “CAN I HAVE TWO CHEESEBURGERS AND SOME FRIES?”
                The librarian looks at him in shock and says “Sir, this is a library!”
                The man, embarrassed, apologetically lowers his voice and whispers “Sorry, can I have two cheeseburgers and some fries?”
