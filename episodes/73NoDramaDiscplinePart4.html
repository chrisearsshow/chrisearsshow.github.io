              <h1>#73. No Drama Discipline Part 4.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 4 is about principles and strategies for applying no drama connection.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: Sounds like it’s going to be a management seminar.
                <p>C: It’s not too far off. Keep in mind the idea is to develop response flexibility. So instead of being reactive, you give space and time for the possibilities. 
                <p>VOJ: We’re still taking about disciplining a child right?
                <p>C: Yes. Okay, here are the principles first. 
                <ol>
                <li>Turn down the shark music
                <li>Chase the why
                <li>Think about the how
                </ol>
                <p>VOJ: I like the first one. Shark music! [Hums Jaws theme]
                <p>C: Right. Except you don’t want that playing in the background of your mind. Shark music represents the past expectations or future fears. For example, if the child was sickly as a baby, the temptation is to attribute all issues to medical health. The suggestion is to instead be present and parent based only on the actual facts of the particular situation. 
                <p>VOJ: [Sings Jaws theme again]
                <p>C: “Chase the why” ties in to that as you play detective to collect more data. “Think about the how” is considering the tone of how you’re communicating. For example, you can say with a loud angry tone, “Get in your car seat” or with clenched teeth, or with a goofy voice.
                <p>VOJ: [Sings Jaws theme speeding up] Get in your car seat!
                <p>C: Alright, and here are the connection strategies. 
                <ol>
                <li>Communicate comfort.
                <li>Validate, validate, validate
                <li>Stop talking and listen
                <li>Reflect what you hear
                </ol>
                <p>VOJ: So basically how you should talk to anyone. 
                <p>C: Pretty much. 
                <p>VOJ: My girlfriend says that I listen to too much Linkin Park. I told her that in the end, it doesn’t even matter.
