              <h1>#56. Making Marriage Work Part 2.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: In this episode, we’re going to answer the question - What makes a marriage work?
<p>Voice Of Judgement: We’re experts now!
<p>C: Pretty much. Two chapters in and we’re ready to be marriage counselors. Okay, what makes a marriage work is a deep friendship. Because this leads to a “positive sentiment override,” or PSO.
<p>VOJ: POS? Piece of …?
<p>C: PSO! It’s when positive thoughts about each other supersede the inevitable disagreements and irritations of married life. Once your marriage gets “set” at a high degree of positivity, it takes far more negativity to harm your relationship than if your “set point” were lower. And if your relationship becomes overwhelmingly negative, it will be more difficult to repair.
<p>VOJ: How do you repair a marriage?
<p>C: One way is with repair attempts. This term refers to any statement
or action that prevents negativity from escalating out of
control. Repair attempts are a secret weapon of emotionally intelligent couples.
<p>VOJ: Example time!
<p>C: Let’s say Olivia and Nathanial are getting in to a big argument. Then all of a
sudden, Olivia puts her hands on her hips and, in perfect imitation of their
four-year-old son, sticks out her tongue. Since Nathaniel knows that she’s
about to do this, he sticks out his tongue first. Then they both start laughing.
As always, this silly contest defuses the tension between them.
<p>VOJ: Got it. Writing it down. Stick… tongue… out… at… wife…
<p>C: One last thing. Arguments are usually about deeper hidden issues. If you remember that, you’ll come to accept one of the most
surprising truths about marriage: most marital arguments cannot be resolved.
Couples spend year after year trying to change each other’s mind—but it can’t
be done. 
<p>VOJ: That’s pretty great job security for marriage counselors.
<p>C: Yeah. Most of the disagreements are rooted in fundamental differences of lifestyle, personality, or values. By fighting over these differences, all couple’s succeed in doing is wasting their time and harming their marriage. Instead, they need to understand the bottom-line difference that is causing the conflict—and to learn how to live with it by honoring and respecting each other.
<p>VOJ: Here’s a story about repair attempts:
My friend Garrick had the solution to forgetting his wife’s birthday and their wedding anniversary: He opened an account with a local florist and provided it with both dates as well as instructions to send flowers and a card signed “Your loving husband, Garrick.” For a few years, it worked. Then one day, Garrick came home on their wedding anniversary. He saw the flowers on the dining room table and said, “What nice flowers. Where did you get them?”
<p>C: Ouch!
