              <h1>#72. No Drama Discipline Part 3.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: “Connection is key” is the title of this next chapter. 
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: Ugh, is it more of connecting to the kid’s feelings?
                <p>C: Yup.  If your child’s behavior is starting to drift from the norm, ask yourself if they’re hungry, angry, lonely, or tired. It’s a proactive parenting approach.
                <p>VOJ: Sounds like a never ending game of hot potato.
                <p>C: Yeah, it means constantly paying attention but it’s less work than having to pick up the pieces after a full meltdown.
                <p>VOJ: Or like pieces of potato after you drop it.
                <p>C: And as a refresher, there are three benefits to connection: 
                <ol>
                <li>It moves the child from reactivity to receptivity.
                <li>It build the brain.
                <li>It deepens your relationship with your child.
                </ol>
                <p>VOJ: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
                <p>C: The authors use the metaphor of staying in the flow of a river. On the one edge of the river is chaos, where things become unmanageable. On the other edge is getting stuck and rigidity, where you’re not able to adapt to the situation. The idea is to stay in the middle.
                <p>VOJ: Okay, be super zen. It’s like this kid is being raised by the Dalai Lama. How is this not spoiling the child?
                <p>C: Spoiling is when parents protect their child from struggling. As we talked about in the last episode, the child still needs boundaries. Connection is not about avoiding  disappointments and difficulties but about being there when they do happen. When children feel seen, safe, and soothed, they feel secure and they thrive. And in turn they can handle tougher situations.
                <p>VOJ: Okay, I’m going to go start a boot camp for kids but with hugs.
                <p>C: Sounds like you’re raising a bunch of serial killers. 
                <p>VOJ: That reminds me of a joke. Last night, I picked up a hitchhiker. He seemed surprised I picked up a stranger and asked, “Thanks but why’d you pick me up? How do you know I’m not a serial killer?” I explained, “Man, the chances of two serial killers in one car would be astronomical.”
