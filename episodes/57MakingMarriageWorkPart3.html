              <h1>#57. Making Marriage Work Part 3.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: In this episode, we’re going to learn how to predict divorce.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Yay!
<p>C: The six predictors that Dr. Gottman looks for are: 
<ol>
<li>The harsh start up
<li>The four horsemen
<li>Flooding
<li>Body language
<li>Failed repair attempts
<li>Bad memories
</ol>
<p>VOJ: So many things can go wrong!
<p>C: Yeah, let’s break them down quickly. The harsh start up is when discussions start off with criticism or sarcasm. 96 percent of the time you can predict the outcome of a conversation based on the first three minutes of a fifteen-minute interaction.
<p>VOJ: No! You’re an idiot! 
<p>C: What?
<p>VOJ: We’re still in the three minute window. Now this conversation is going to suck.
<p>C: Yes, it will. Thank you for that. The second sign is the four horseman which are criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling.
<p>VOJ: I’m not listening to you!
<p>C: Possibly because you’re psychologically and physically overwhelmed. Which leads to the third sign - flooding. It’s when your spouse’s negativity is so intense and sudden that it leaves you shell-shocked.
<p>VOJ: I can’t believe we still have more signs to go.
<p>C: Yup, the fourth is body language. Like an increase in heart rate, adrenaline and blood pressure. The interesting thing is that women are better at calming down, while the male cardiovascular system is more reactive and slower to recover from stress. 
<p>VOJ: Women are better!
<p>C: In so many ways. The fifth sign is failed repair attempts. The presence of the four horsemen alone predicts divorce with an 82 percent accuracy rate. But when you add in the failure of repair attempts, the accuracy rate reaches into the 90s.
<p>VOJ: I’m sorry for calling you an idiot earlier.
<p>C: That’s okay. Thank you for apologizing. Sometimes we argue with ourselves. Which finally brings us to the sixth and last sign, bad memories. When a marriage is not going well, history gets rewritten for the worse in each other’s minds.
<p>VOJ: Yay! We made it to the end. Here’s a joke to close the show:
As Farmer Brown approached his neighbor’s barn, he saw Farmer Jones serenading a tractor with songs and compliments.  “What are you doing?” Farmer Brown demanded. Farmer Jones replied, “My wife and I have been having marital difficulties, and the marital counselor said I needed to do something sexy to a tractor."
