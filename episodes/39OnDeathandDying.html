              <h1>#39. On Death And Dying.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The book today is by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross and is titled “On Death and Dying”.
<p>Voice OF Judgement: Another book on death? How many of these are we going to do?
<p>C: Until we run out of them? At least we didn’t cry this time.
<p>VOJ: It was allergies!!!
<p>C: Sure. So the book was written in 1969 and surprisingly is still relevant and relatable. 
<p>VOJ: What? You thought we would have cured death by now?
<p>C: No, but I figured we would be better at talking about it.
<p>VOJ: You must be great at parties.
<p>C: Maybe at funerals? The author shares a few reasons for death being a taboo topic.
<p>VOJ: Like what?
<p>C: The shift away from religion; the increasing destructive power of weapons that add to our anxiety of death; and the focus shifting from the individual to the masses. This has led to medical patients being depersonalized and the emotional process of death getting lost.
<p>VOJ: Ah, so the author is bringing that back. 
<p>C: Exactly. The book is aimed at the medical community and the author’s hope is that we examine our own feelings about death and learn to communicate about it.
<p>VOJ: Why is that important?
<p>C: By being able to listen and allow for the emotions, doctors can help the patient and his family get “in tune” to each other’s needs and hopefully avoid unnecessary agony and suffering.
<p>VOJ: What are the emotions? 
<p>C: The author breaks them down in to five stages which have become rather infamous.
<p>VOJ: I know them! I know them! Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance!
<p>C: Nice. People sometimes mistakenly assume that the stages are followed in an orderly fashion. When really they can overlap and occur at different times. The stages are to give you a framework so you’re prepared to talk about them. 
<p>VOJ: Like how?
<p>C: For example in the denial stage, it’s important for the doctor to take in to account the patients personality and to share the bad news in small steps. To give the patient time to process.
<p>VOJ: How about anger?
<p>C: To be prepared for the severity and random lashing out. It’s often a struggle for control. If you bring some sense of control back in to the patient’s life they often calm down. 
<p>VOJ: And bargaining?
<p>C: It can be a reflection of the guilt of things not done and a scramble to do those things in an effort to postpone death. Allow them to talk those things over.  
<p>VOJ: How about depression?
<p>C: There’s two kinds. Reactive and preparatory. Reactive is mourning what the illness has already taken away. Here’s where encouragement can be helpful. But with preparatory, this is less meaningful. They’re processing the future loss of everything. With this type of depression, silence and being present is most helpful.
<p>VOJ: And finally acceptance!
<p>C: At this stage the patient is almost void of feelings. This is the time when the family usually needs more support than the patient. The patient may wish to be left alone and is slowly detaching from the outside world.
<p>VOJ: That’s a lot to process.
<p>C: Yeah, hence the need to talk about death. The sooner you can talk about it, the more time you have to go through the process. The author points out that death can be a gift and dying can be a productive time of growth. 
<p>VOJ: Huh. Maybe even something to look forward to?
<p>C: Yeah. Quite possibly. Here’s a story quote to demonstrate that and to close out the show:
<p>Mr. H. was regarded as a grim, non-communicating man by the
hospital staff, and their prediction was that he would not agree to
talking with us. At the beginning of the session, he warned us that
he was likely to collapse if he sat for more than five minutes—yet,
after a full hour of conversation he had difficulty leaving and felt
perfectly all right physically as well as emotionally. He was pre-
occupied with many personal losses, the most serious one the death
of a daughter far away. What grieved him most, however, was the
loss of hope. 
<p>Later in the interview he expresses another sense of hopeless-
ness, namely his inability to have his wife share some of his inter-
ests and values in life. She often made him feel like a failure, he was
blamed for the children’s lack of achievements, he did not bring
enough money home, and he was fully aware that it was too late to
satisfy her demands and ever meet her expectations. As he felt
weaker and unable to work, looking back at his life, he became
even more aware of the discrepancy between her values and his
own. The gap seemed to be so great that communication became
almost impossible. 
<p>So we could not help but wish to be
instrumental in a final communication between the patient and his
wife. We finally understood why the hospital staff was unable to tell
how much Mr. H. was aware of his illness. He was not thinking of
his cancer as much as he was reviewing the meaning of his life and
searching for ways to share this with the most significant person—
his wife. 
<p>The following morning we met with her, a strong, powerful,
healthy woman, energetic as he had described. She confirmed
almost verbatim what he had said the day before: “Life will go on
much the same when he has ceased to be.” He was weak, he could
not even cut the lawn or else he might faint. Men on the farm were
a different kind of people, they had muscles and were strong. They
worked from sunrise to sundown and he was not much interested in
making money either. . . . Mrs. H. said
this all in a tone of a busy woman who had a lot of other things to
attend to and could not be bothered. 
<p>Maybe at that time I felt
impatient or had a sense of Mr. H.’s hopelessness, but I repeated in
my own words once more the essence of her communications. I
summarized briefly that Mr. H. had not fulfilled her expectations,
he was not very good in many things really, and would not be
mourned when he ceased to be. Looking back at his life, one might
wonder if there was anything memorable in it. . . .
Mrs. H. suddenly looked at me, and with feeling in her voice she
almost yelled: “What do you mean, he was the most honest and the
most faithful man in the world.”
<p>We sat for another few minutes during which time I shared with
her some of the things that we had heard in the interview. Mrs. H.
admitted that she had never thought of him in these terms and was
quite willing to give him credit for these assets. We returned to the
patient’s room together and Mrs. H. repeated on her own what we
exchanged in our office. 
<p>I shall not forget the patient’s pale face
deep in his pillows, the expectant look on his face, the wonderment
in his expression at whether we were able to communicate. And
then his eyes lit up when he heard his own wife say, “. . . and I told
her that you were the most honest and most faithful man in the
world, and that’s hard to find these days. And on the way home we
would pass by the church and pick up some of your church work
that was so meaningful to you. It will keep you busy for the next
few days.”
<p>There was some genuine warmth in her voice when she talked
with him and prepared him to leave the hospital. “I shall never
forget you as long as I live,” he said when I left the room—both of
us knowing that this would not be long, but it mattered little at this
point.
