              <h1>#48. The Art Of Possibility Part 5.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 6 is about Rule Number 6. Here’s a story that explains it:
<p>Two prime ministers are sitting in a room discussing affairs of state.
Suddenly a man bursts in, apoplectic with fury, shouting and
stamping and banging his fist on the desk. The resident prime
minister admonishes him: “Peter,” he says, “kindly remember Rule
Number 6,” whereupon Peter is instantly restored to complete calm,
apologizes, and withdraws. The politicians return to their
conversation, only to be interrupted yet again twenty minutes later by
an hysterical woman gesticulating wildly, her hair flying. Again the
intruder is greeted with the words: “Marie, please remember Rule
Number 6.” Complete calm descends once more, and she too
withdraws with a bow and an apology. When the scene is repeated
for a third time, the visiting prime minister addresses his colleague:
“My dear friend, I’ve seen many things in my life, but never anything
as remarkable as this. Would you be willing to share with me the
secret of Rule Number 6?” “Very simple,” replies the resident prime
minister. “Rule Number 6 is ‘Don’t take yourself so seriously.’” “Ah,” says his visitor, “that is a fine rule.” After a moment
of pondering, he inquires, “And what, may I ask, are the other rules?”
“Oh, there aren’t any.”
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Rule Number 6! Rule Number 6! Don’t take yourself so seriously! That doesn’t really rhyme.
<p>C: Yeah, it doesn’t. So the rule is to help move away from a survival mentality. When we’re in a survival mentality, we take ourselves very seriously and focus on how our needs aren’t being met. 
<p>VOJ: How do I know if I’m in a survival mentality?
<p>C: Ask yourself, “What would have to change for me to be completely fulfilled?” The answer will usually tell you what you’re taking very seriously.
<p>VOJ: What’s wrong with taking things seriously?
<p>C: It limits you from the universe of possibilities, which then limits what solutions you have to your problems. Or it makes the problems seem bigger than they are. 
<p>VOJ: What’s it look like to not be in a survival mentality?
<p>C: Here’s a story from Vikram Savkar, that might demonstrate this;
<p>Last night, I visited one of my old college haunts, a seedy diner
located south of the campus. I took a place at the counter next to a
man who appeared, on a second look, to be homeless. Before him,
meticulously laid out, were three dollar bills and some change,
apparently all he had in the world. When the waitress appeared, I
ordered a hamburger—but the man put out his hand as if to slow me
down. With a grand gesture, he announced, “It’s on me. You can
have anything you want tonight, and you won’t pay a penny. It’s all
on me.” I protested that I could not possibly do that. He was offering
me the whole of his worldly possessions, and I certainly could not
accept such a gift. But he was determined to have his moment. “You
are going to have what you want, and it’s on me.” He pushed all his
money toward the indifferent woman behind the counter.
I was aware of every delicious bite of that hamburger, every sip of
coffee. With a mere three dollars and fifty-odd cents, this man had
created a humane world brimming over with charity and abundance.
This momentary universe teemed with delicious smells from the grill,
while voices of happiness emanated from a couple chatting at a
booth. And I, I had the deeply satisfying experience of being there
while all this took place. I thanked him for everything.
“Oh, no,” he said, winking at my last-ditch efforts to find some
parity. “The pleasure’s all mine.”
<p>VOJ: Now I’m hungry.
<p>C: Yeah, me too. Okay, here’s a final anecdote to drive the point home about not taking yourself so seriously. It’s from Guerda Weissman Kline, talking about her childhood friend that she met in Auschwitz. 
<p>Ilse, who was about six years old at the time, found one morning a single
raspberry somewhere in the camp. Ilse carried it all day long in a
protected place in her pocket, and in the evening, her eyes shining
with happiness, she presented it to Guerda on a leaf.
“Imagine a world,” writes Guerda, “in which your entire possession is
one raspberry, and you give it to your friend.”
