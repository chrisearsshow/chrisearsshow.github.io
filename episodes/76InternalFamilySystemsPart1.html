              <h1>#76. Internal Family Systems Part 1.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: We’re starting a new book called “Introduction to the Internal Family Systems Model” by Richard Schwartz.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: Instead of an external family, we’re going to start an internal family.
                <p>C: Right. Except we already have an internal family. The idea of the IFS model is to have all the members get along.
                <p>VOJ: What if I’m the voice that causes you pain?
                <p>C: Especially if you’re that voice. Suppressing you is what usually causes more trouble. Also, it’s not your fault. You were forced in to an extreme role by things that happened in our life.
                <p>VOJ: Okay, so what happens when we get along?
                <p>C: Then other qualities like curiosity, compassion, contentment can reveal themselves. 
                <p>VOJ: That’s a lot of C words.
                <p>C: Oh, there’s also, calmness, confidence, courage, clarity and creativity.
                <p>VOJ: Sounds like the book is just an excuse to alliterate.
                <p>C: Well, that’s a voice that needs love too! The first chapter closes with some exercises where you reflect on what’s it like being made up of different voices and how those voices might be relating to each other.
                <p>VOJ: Our voices talk to each other and make a podcast.
                <p>C: I wonder what voices we’re ignoring. 
                <p>VOJ: Probably the voice that says we should only eat pizza and ice cream.
                <p>C: That’s not another voice. That’s you.
                <p>VOJ: Or maybe the voice that thinks that we don’t watch enough TV.
                <p>C: Also you.
                <p>VOJ: Or the voice that wants a new video game.
