							 <p>Chris: Chapter 12 is about using conflict productively.
<p>Other Voice: By making sure to win and making the other person a loser.
<p>C: That would be the easy solution. Unfortunately, conflict is rarely that simple. Let’s say you rely on your parents for childcare, which they’re happy to provide, but they are tougher disciplinarians. It upsets you, but you’re afraid if you call them on it, they’ll back away from giving you the childcare that you need. It seems like your needs are mutually exclusive: You want the free childcare, done with a softer hand, and they want to be firm. Also, what if they accuse you of taking advantage of their generosity? Or what if it brings up unresolved feelings about how strict they were with you when you were a kid?
<p>OV: Ugh, people are so complicated.
<p>C: Thankfully if you stick to the four variations on the feedback model, you'll probably make good progress. As a reminder, here they are again:
<ol>
<li>This is how your behavior is affecting me.
<li>Your behavior is not meeting your goals.
<li>Your behavior may be meeting your goals, but it is costly to you.
<li>Am I doing anything that is causing that behavior?
</ol>
<p>OV: One, you always do lists. Two, people don't like lists.
<p>C: Okay, then just one further reminder. Stay on your side of the net. When emotions are high it's tempting to make accusations and assumptions about the other person's experience. Or to name call and get defensive.
<p>OV: What if the other person doesn't stay on their side of the net. Or isn't fighting fair?
<p>C: Intense disagreements produce strong emotions, which can make it difficult to hear the other person’s concerns and lead to more deeply entrenched positions and a greater risk of escalation. One solution is to take frequent breaks. 
<p>OV: Isn't that just stonewalling?
<p>C: There’s an important distinction between refusal to deal with a situation and taking some time and space to let thoughts and feelings settle. Self-reflection is almost impossible when you are highly emotionally triggered. But to make sure it's not avoidance or stonewalling, set a specific time to come back to the issue.
<p>OV: What if the person keeps leaving?
<p>C: Conflict is scary, uncomfortable, and messy. We're scared that we'll be hurt or hurt the other or that the relationship might end. But ending the conversation only increases the likelihood of permanent deadlock. It also results in little to no learning.
<p>OV: So it feels terrible and you want people to keep doing it.
<p>C: Unfortunately hanging in there with the uncomfortable feelings is the way to go. But you can take frequent breaks, trust the process and hopefully get glimpses of empathy and curiosity for the other person.
<p>OV: My chiropractor and I got into a terrible fight in the middle of my neck treatment.
Now I have to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
<p>C: I really wonder if anyone else enjoys these jokes.
<p>OV: Today I saw two blind guys fighting. You should've seen their faces when I said "My money's on the one with the knife."
<p>C: Now you're making fun of blind people?
<p>OV: Okay, what do you do when you see 2 snails fighting? Nothing. You let them slug it out.
<p>C: And that's all folks. As a heads up, we've got a few more chapters to go in this book, and then we'll be wrapping it up on this podcast. It's been over two years and it's been a fun experiment but I've learned what I wanted from the process. I appreciate you listening and hanging in there as I went through the learning curve. If you want to get in touch, please email me at chrisearsshow@gmail.com. Thank you for listening and I'll talk to you soon!
