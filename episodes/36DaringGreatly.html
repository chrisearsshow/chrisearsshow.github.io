              <h1>#36. Daring Greatly.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today’s book is Daring Greatly by Brene Brown.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Hey, it’s the expert on shame.
<p>C: Yup. And this time she talks about how it relates to vulnerability.
<p>VOJ: And how does it relate?
<p>C: Vulnerability is the antidote to shame. 
<p>VOJ: How’s that?
<p>C: In the previous podcast, when we talked about her book “Rising Strong”, shame was defined as feeling unworthy. In “Daring Greatly”, Brown adds that shame is the fear of social disconnection. Vulnerability is the courage to reach out, share your story and engage the world fully and openly.
<p>VOJ: Sounds risky.
<p>C: It is. But with out vulnerability - love, relationships and emotions can’t happen.
<p>VOJ: Yeah, I don’t know. 
<p>C: The author also talks about different types of armor we use against vulnerability.
<p>VOJ: What are those?
<p>C: Foreboding joy, perfectionism, numbing, viking or victim, letting it all hang out, serpentining, cynicism, criticism, cool, cruelty.
<p>VOJ: That’s so many!
<p>C: Yeah, there’s seven. Let me break them down, along with the tools to combat them.
<p>VOJ: Okay! One!
<p>C: Foreboding joy is when something good is happening and imagining the worst that could happen. Practicing gratitude is a way to combat that.
<p>VOJ: Two! 
<p>C: Perfectionism, which is a defensive move against blame, judgment and shame. Not about striving for excellence. The remedy to perfectionism is to appreciate the beauty of our weaknesses.
<p>VOJ: Three! Ha! Ha! Ha!
<p>C: Numbing, which is different types of addiction, including keeping busy, so that you don’t have to feel. The author suggests three tools to counter numbing. Setting boundaries, finding true comfort and cultivating spirit.
<p>VOJ: Can you give me an example?
<p>C: Let’s say you’re overwhelmed with email. You could stay busy and try to answer all of them. Or you could set the boundary with people that you might take a few days to reply to emails. Finding true comfort and cultivating spirit is about paying attention to how you feel when you’re pursuing leisure activities. Does Netflixing recharge you or drain you?
<p>VOJ: Got it! Four! Ha! Ha! Ha!
<p>C: Viking or victim, which is the mentality that there are only winners or losers in the world. It usually comes up in competitive environments like the military, where suppressing strong emotional reactions is the norm. The author recommends the tools of redefining success, reintegrating vulnerability, and seeking support.
<p>VOJ: Five! Dun! Dun! Dun!
<p>C: “Letting it all hang it out”, which is sharing too much too soon. The author breaks it in to two categories - flood lighting or the smash and grab. Flood lighting is about over loading the relationship to test it and the smash and grab is to share too much information for the attention. The tools to combat this is by clarifying intentions, setting boundaries and cultivating connection. 
<p>VOJ: Six!
<p>C: Serpentining is about avoiding or ignoring a situation. The tools for this are being present, paying attention and moving forward.
<p>VOJ: Seven!
<p>C: The last shield is made of cynicism, criticism, cool, cruelty. The remedies are tightrope walking, practicing shame resilience and reality checking.
<p>VOJ: What are those?
<p>C: Tightrope walking is striking a balance between being open and being too open. Yes, connect and take in feedback. But in amounts that you can digest, with people that you trust. Those people will help shine a light on your shame and reality check the criticism and cynicism. 
<p>VOJ: So many shields!
<p>C: Yeah. I think we use all of them.
<p>VOJ: Explains why we’re talking to ourselves.
<p>C: You got that right. Okay, the closing quote is what the book title is based on and is from Theodore Roosevelt:
<p>“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the
doer of deeds could have done them better.
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat
and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again,
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause;
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at
least fails while daring greatly.…”
