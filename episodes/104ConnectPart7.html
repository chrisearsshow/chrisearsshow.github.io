							 <p>Chris: Chapter 8 delves into the common pitfalls of giving feedback.
<p>Other Voice: Ugh, this is the never-ending “we need to talk” speech.
<p>C: Yeah, unfortunately, one piece of feedback doesn’t usually resolve the issue.
<p>OV: This is why we only talk to ourselves.
<p>C: Right. One of the reasons we’re uncomfortable with feedback is the emotions.
<p>OV: So many emotions!!!
<p>C: And when they come up we have a lot of excuses not to share them. Commons ones are: 
<ul>
<li>I shouldn’t feel [insert emotion]
<li>I can’t justify my feelings in this context
<li>I’m sure this feeling will pass
<li>My feelings contradict each other
<li>I’m so mad I don’t trust myself to speak
</ul>
<p>OV: Sounds like good reasons to just suck it up.
<p>C: Except then you deny your own reality and what’s important to you. With each of those excuses, there are strategies to deal with them. When you feel like you shouldn’t feel a certain emotion, remember there’s a difference between how you feel and what actions you take. Feelings are never “wrong.” What might be inappropriate is how you express them or what you attribute the cause to.
<p>OV: Aren’t feelings just going to pass?
<p>C: Some feelings do pass, but others may linger. Even if you choose not to raise your annoyance and the feelings dissipate in the next hour, that doesn’t mean they have entirely disappeared. Maybe they are “parked” somewhere and will come alive with even greater force the next time the problematic behavior comes up.
<p>OV: Yeah, but sometimes I feel good and bad at the same time.
<p>C: Then express them both. If the feelings are too intense then say that and take some time to process them. When it becomes more manageable, then you can express it. 
<p>OV: What happens if I don’t express my emotions?
<p>C: Then the tendency is to start making up stories and to put labels on people.
<p>OV: And that’s how we become racist.
<p>C: The trick is to notice the unconscious habit and reflect on what is it about the specific behavior that bothers you. Then see if you can leverage our storytelling tendencies to develop a positive explanation. 
<p>OV: That person robbed me because they love me!
<p>C: A third option is to simply name your storytelling habit. For example, “I notice that when you rob me, it leads me to make up a story that you’re an evil person.”
<p>OV: I am! Now hand over your wallet!
<p>C: This brings us to the four stages of problem-solving. 
<ul>
<li>Stage 1: Getting the other person to take the feedback seriously
<li>Stage 2: Sharing all the issues
<li>Stage 3: Resolution
<li>Stage 4: Repair
</ul>
<p>OV: Stage 5: Go home and watch TV.
<p>C: To get you to take this seriously, there are a few approaches I can take. I can tell you, “This is how your behavior is affecting me.” Or I can point out that, “Your behavior is not meeting your goals.” Or offer the observation that, “You might be meeting your goals, but you’re paying some unnecessary costs.” Or finally, bring it back to myself and ask, “Am I doing anything that is causing your behavior?”
<p>OV: This is why nobody does feedback - there’s too much to remember!
<p>C: Yeah, it definitely seems like a skill that could take a lifetime to master. This ties in nicely with stage 2 which is about sharing all the issues. The authors admit it can get messy. They suggest imagining that you’re in a muddy swamp, and you need to cross it to get to the high ground on the other side. At first, you carefully look for rocks to step on so you don’t get muddy. But halfway across, there are no more rocks. You have a choice: “Do I get in and walk through the mud, or should I turn around?” Turning around ends the discussion, with one person walking out of the room or, just as dysfunctional, saying, “Let’s just agree to disagree.” The latter might make sense when it comes to politics or large ideological differences, but not in the context of building robust relationships.
<p>OV: Then let’s just become politicians instead.
<p>C: And like politicians, we want to seek a resolution which is stage 3.  Rather than searching for “an answer,” it is important to recognize that there are multiple desired outcomes. First, you want to ensure the discussion has solved the initial problems in a way that satisfies both people. Second, you want the discussion to improve your problem-solving ability. The third and fourth objectives deal with aspects of the relationship itself. Do you know each other better because in the discussion you’ve shared relevant parts of yourself? And finally, has your relationship improved as a result of the effort?
<p>OV: This is probably why politicians want to get paid so much.
<p>C: I’m starting to think they deserve it. Stage 4 is about repair. The process may not have been an easy one; things might have been said that caused hurt or regret. Has the importance of the relationship to both of you been lost in this process? Has one or both of you felt devalued? Saying “I’m sorry” is often a critical component of repair, but many people can’t bring themselves to say the phrase.  Beyond apologies, affirm the other, and assure them that the relationship matters. And last, check back the next day to see if any of these stages need revisiting.
<p>OV: I’m not going to remember any of this.
<p>C: Okay, just remember this. The key determining factor for both relationship development and individual growth is the ability to learn.
<p>OV: No more learning for me!!!
<p>C: Okay, then for our listeners. Accepting the validity of someone’s feedback also doesn’t mean you must act on it. Feedback is information for you to decide what to do with. It’s data with which to expand your choices. It’s like clothes—try it on and see if it fits.
<p>OV: An old man opens his bathroom door and finds a woman wearing no clothes. The woman says, “I’m here to give you super sex.” After thinking for a moment the old man replies, “I guess I’ll have the soup.”
<p>C: I wonder where he met the woman.
<p>OV: The old man went to a bar with his best clothes on. He wore his best suit, his favorite silk tie, and a flower on his lapel. When he sees the beautiful woman, he goes up to her and asks, “Tell me, good-looking, do I come here often?”
