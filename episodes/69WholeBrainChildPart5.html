              <h1>#69. The Whole Brain Child Part 5.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Alright, the last two strategies of the whole brain child are: Increase the family fun factor. And connect through conflict.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Like going to Disney and arguing about which ride to take?
<p>C: Kind of. The point of family fun is showing your children that their closest relationships are positive experiences and not just about discipline.
<p>VOJ: Or ubering them everywhere.
<p>C: Exactly. The connect through conflict strategy is about teaching kids to argue with a “We” in mind.
<p>VOJ: Weeeee!
<p>C: As in less about me, more about we. It’s about using the empathy skills of the upstairs brain like recognizing other points of view and attunement. It’s also learning to repair the relationship when mistakes are made.
<p>VOJ: That’s hard enough as an adult. You want children to do this?
<p>C: Which is one of the points that the authors make. We want to model the behavior we want the child to learn. And that behavior is attunement and integration. That’s probably different from the previous generations of parenting styles.
<p>VOJ: Yeah, I don’t see grandpa and grandma throwing an emotions party.
<p>C: They probably didn’t have the time or support to process them.
<p>VOJ: Man, that sucks. You remember the last thing our grandpa said to us before he kicked the bucket. He said "Hey, how far do you think I can kick this bucket?"
