							 <p>Chris: Chapter 11 goes into detail about how to break a logjam in a relationship.
<p>OV: This chapter really sucks.
<p>C: Probably because it makes us so uncomfortable. Conflict isn't fun. But it helps to remember that others can influence us, but they need not control us.
<p>OV: I'm still not convinced.
<p>C: Okay, let's take the first baby step, which is to understand your own needs and feelings, and then speak those needs and feelings out loud. No one is a mind reader. Then and only then can you move into mutual problem-solving and repair.
<p>OV: It's always about feelings!
<p>C: Yup. After that comes the balance of responsibility.
<p>OV: But it's not my fault!
<p>C: Maybe. There can be a danger in not taking responsibility for the other person’s
reactions. It means I'm not owning the fact that I'm in a relationship with the other person. Conversely, there can be danger in taking too much
responsibility. That means the other person is a helpless victim. Again, the balance is holding both statements, "I have a choice" and "I am affected by you", as equally valid.
<p>OV: So not one or the other.
<p>C: Right. Even though conflict can feel stressful and even dangerous, it can actually be helpful. Conflict can surface issues in a very direct way. It can bring out emotions, indicating what’s really going on so you know where others stand.
<p>OV: We should get into fights more often.
<p>C: The next chapter goes into more detail about using conflict productively.
<p>OV: I once got into a fight with 1,3,5,7 and 9. The odds were against me.
<p>C: Sigh.
<p>OV: They say you should never fight a math teacher. You’ll always be outnumbered.
<p>C: Math fighting jokes? Really?
<p>OV: They also say don't pick a fight with a dinosaur. Otherwise, you'll get jurasskicked.
<p>C: This is why nobody listens to this podcast.
