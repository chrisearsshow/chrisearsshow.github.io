              <h1>#45. The Art Of Possibility Part 2.</h1>
							  <p>Chapter 2 is about expanding our perspective from the world of measurement to the universe of possibility. The world of measurement perspective comes from scarcity or survival thinking. 
<p>True scarcity is when someone’s life is in daily danger and they can’t fulfill their fundamental needs. Scarcity thinking is about having a fatalistic outlook on life.
<p>An example of scarcity thinking is comparing yourself to others. Being graded as children is what probably led to us to the type of thinking. 
<p>Education unfortunately often focuses on what’s lacking in students. What if instead, like Michelangelo with a block of marble, it focused on revealing what was hidden?
<p>That’s what chapter 3 is about. “Giving an A.” Benjamin, a music conductor, was frustrated with his class of music students. He was teaching them the emotional and psychological aspects of music performance but he couldn’t figure out how to get them to take risks. The students were too worried about their grade. 
<p>Rosamund, a therapist, suggested a practice to help change their perspective. At the beginning of the semester, the students were to write a letter by their future self about why they had earned an A for the semester.  Everything was to be written in past tense, with none of the words “I hope” or “I will”. 
<p>Here’s an example:
<p>“Dear Mr. Zander,
I got my A because I had the courage to examine my fears and I
realized that they have no place in my life. I changed from someone
who was scared to make a mistake in case she was noticed to
someone who knows that she has a contribution to make to other
people, musically and personally.”
<p>The results of the practice wasn’t just felt by the students. Benjamin started looking forward to spending every Friday afternoon with his A students. The students, in turn, got to enjoy a glowing afternoon with their fellow A students, taking a break from the normal anxiety and despair of the music academy.
<p>Benjamin had shared the practice of “Giving an A” in a talk to a group of business executives. One of the executives, shared how it affected his relationship with his father [in a letter to Benjamin].
<p>‘You told us, as you were about to play Chopin, to use the time to
reflect on someone no longer in our lives. I thought about my father
and again about that nagging question which I could never answer—
why couldn’t he say “I love you”?
<p>And then, as I listened to your music, the memory came back of
an evening, more than 45 years ago, when I was again sick, and
Father came upstairs. But this evening was different. He sat next to
me on my bed and, as I was sitting upright and struggling for the
next breath, he began gently stroking my hair for a period of time
that I wished would have lasted an eternity.
<p>Today, as you played us the Chopin, tears came to my eyes. It
struck me that while Father could not say these words, “I love you,”
they were expressed even more poignantly in the gentle stroking of a
little boy’s hair by his father’s powerful hands. I recall that as he sat
with me my asthma attack subsided.
<p>I had completely forgotten that incident. I must have buried it in
my own desire to perhaps keep my father at a distance, to
continuously prove either that I was unlovable, or that he was just a
cold s.o.b. who only knew work, work, and more work. But not so.
My father showed me love in so many ways.’
<p>And to finally drive the point home, here’s a story to demonstrate the practice of giving an A. It’s called the Rabbi’s gift. 
<p>A monastery has fallen on hard times. There were only five monks left:
the Abbot and four others, all of whom were over seventy. Clearly it
was a dying church.
<p>Deep in the woods surrounding the monastery was a little hut that
the Rabbi from a nearby town occasionally used. One day, it occurred to the Abbot to visit the Rabbi to see if he had any advice that might save the monastery. The
Rabbi welcomed the Abbot and sympathized, “The spirit has gone out of people. Almost no one comes to the synagogue anymore.” So the old Rabbi and the old Abbot wept
together, and they read parts of the Torah and spoke quietly of deep
things.
<p>The time came when the Abbot had to leave and they embraced. “It
has been wonderful being with you,” said the Abbot, “have you any advice that
might save the monastery?” 
<p>“No, I am sorry,” the Rabbi responded, “I have no advice to give. The only thing I can tell you is that the Messiah is one of you.”
<p>When the other monks heard the Rabbi’s words, they began wondering, “The Messiah is one of us? Do you suppose he meant
the Abbot? Of course, it must be the Abbot, he’s been our
leader for so long. On the other hand, he might have meant Brother
Thomas, who is undoubtedly a holy man. Certainly he couldn’t have
meant Brother Elrod, he’s so cranky. But then Elrod is very wise.
Surely, he could not have meant Brother Phillip, he’s too passive.
But then, magically, he’s always there when you need him. Of course
he didn’t mean me… did he mean me?
<p>As they kept thinking about it, the old monks began to
treat each other with extraordinary respect, on the off chance that
one of them might be the Messiah. And on the off off chance that
each monk himself might be the Messiah, they began to treat
themselves with extraordinary respect.
<p>Because the forest in which it was situated was beautiful, people
occasionally came to visit the monastery, to picnic or to meditate in the chapel. Then the visitors started to notice this aura of extraordinary respect that surrounded and radiated from the five old monks.
<p>They began to come
more frequently, bringing their friends, and their friends brought
friends. Some of the younger men who came to visit began to
engage in conversation with the monks. 
<p>After a while, one asked if
he might join. Then another, and another. Within a few years, the
monastery became once again a thriving church, and—thanks to the
Rabbi’s gift—a vibrant, authentic community of light and love.
