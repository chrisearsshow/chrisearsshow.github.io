              <h1>#44. The Art Of Possibility Part 1.</h1>
							  <p>For the next several episodes, I’m going to be covering the “Art of possibility” by Rosamund and Benjamin Zander. It’s a fun book, so I’m going to take my time with it. 
<p>I’m also going to take a break from the other voice. If I miss it, I’ll bring it back. 
<p>Saying “I” so much is going to take some getting used to.
<p>Chapter 1 is titled “It’s All Invented”. Since our brains are finite and constantly interpreting the world, why not interpret it in a way that allows for more possibilities?
<p>Most of us take for granted how we interpret the world. For example, photos. When the Me’en people of Ethiopia were first shown photos, they were more interested in the paper than the images. “They felt the paper, sniffed it, crumpled it, and listened to the crackling noise it made; they nipped off little bits and chewed them to taste it.”
<p>Here’s another story that demonstrates different interpretations of the world. 
<p>A shoe factory sends two marketing scouts to a region of Africa
to study the prospects for expanding business. 
<p>One sends back a telegram saying,
SITUATION HOPELESS STOP NO ONE WEARS SHOES
<p>The other writes back triumphantly,
GLORIOUS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY STOP THEY HAVE NO SHOES
<p>Each chapter has a practice that goes with it. Here’s my version. Ask yourself, 
<ol>
<li>What thought am I having?
<li>What assumption is that thought based on?
<li>What new assumption would give me more possibilities?
</ol>
<p>There you go. That’s chapter 1, “It’s All Invented”.
