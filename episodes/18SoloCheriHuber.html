              <h1>18. Me.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Hi! I'm here with myself and today we're going to talk about a book called, "There's nothing wrong with you" by Cheri Huber. Say hi myself.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Hey!
<p>C: It's a book that I think everyone should read. 
<p>VOJ: It's been translated in to all the languages, eh?
<p>C: Uh, actually I don't know that.
<p>VOJ: Then how is everyone going to read it?
<p>C: Look, what I mean is that most people will get a lot out of it.
<p>VOJ: You could have just said that. No need to be hyperbolic.
<p>C: Look, can we just get through the introduction?
<p>VOJ: Sure. Make like Beauty and the Beast. Be my guest.
<p>C: Sigh. Okay. A housemate first told me about the book and how he found it in a book store and started reading it. And when he started reading it, he started crying.
<p>VOJ: Oh man, what a wimp.
<p>C: The message was something he'd been waiting to hear his whole life. Most people are. So now he keeps several copies on hand and gives them away. I've read it a few times and it's always good for whenever you need a self hug.
<p>VOJ: I guess that's better than self arguing.
<p>C: The gist of the book is that our caregivers, in the process of socializing us, inadvertantly create this voice of judgement. That's what our ego latches on to and creates our seperateness. 
<p>VOJ: Based on a lot of scientific data is it?
<p>C: I don't know but it made sense to me. We hold on to that seperateness and our identity is way of dealing with our mortality.
<p>VOJ: Like creating another pesonality to argue with?
<p>C: Actually it might be healthy. Often times, we turn our attention outward for our need. And the original unmet need is to be loved and accepted exactly as we are. So arguing with myself is a good way to accept my voice of judgment.
<p>VOJ: Well, that kind of takes the wind out of my sails. 
<p>C: Oh, don't worry. You'll find something. You've had decades of practice. Which brings me to the next part. The self battering cycle. We get stressed out and to cope, we succumb to an addiction or coping behavior. We feel a bit better in the short term but then worse. So then we decide to be perfect. Which is impossible and so we stress ourselves out again. Rinse and repeat. 
<p>VOJ: That sounds terrible.
<p>C: Yeah, we all do it.
<p>VOJ: How do you get out of it?
<p>C: Presence.
<p>VOJ: Ooo, I like presents.
<p>C: No, not gifts. Being present. Like meditation. Or focusing on the now.
<p>VOJ: Ugh, not that Eckhart Tolle nut.
<p>C: Well, not in this episode. 
<p>VOJ: You're turning in to Oprah.
<p>C: Why is that a bad thing? 
<p>VOJ: Well, you're not a black woman.
<p>C: I'm not sure you understand what made her successful.
<p>VOJ: Look, just get on with it.
<p>C: Okay, so presence can be uncomfortable because you're not in control. When you're focused on the past or future, it feels like you're in control. Being in the present is about going with the flow.
<p>VOJ: Huh, like stream of consciousness.
<p>C: Sure. It's how some of our best ideas come about. Like talking to myself.
<p>VOJ: Or writing.
<p>C: Yup. And being present is really about being kind to yourself. Being okay with just being with yourself.
<p>VOJ: So this other voice is just a way to love yourself? 
<p>C: Yeah.
<p>VOJ: Hey, you tricked me.
<p>C: Huh. Funny how that worked out that way. Okay, this seems like a good stopping point. We'll come back to the book in another episode. Here's a quote to finish up.
<p>“All of life's conflicts are between letting go or holding on, opening into the present or clinging to the past, expansion or contraction.” 
<p>VOJ: You sound like a fortune cookie.
<p>C: Thanks. Say bye.
<p>VOJ: Bye!
