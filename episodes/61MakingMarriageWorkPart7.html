              <h1>#61. Making Marriage Work Part 7.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: In chapter 10, Gottman talks about the areas where conflict often comes up. Those are work stress, in-laws, money, sex, housework, Internet-fueled distractions, and a new baby.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Is it more about being nice?
<p>C: Yeah. With each area, he suggests a way of talking about it so you can understand each other better. Like with money it’s about balancing the freedom and empowerment money represents with the security and trust it also symbolizes. Or with sex, it’s about fundamental appreciation and acceptance of each other.
<p>VOJ: I hate this book.
<p>C: Don’t worry, this is our last episode on it. Okay, principle 6 is about overcoming gridlock. Gridlock is when you’re having the same argument again and again with no humor, empathy, or affection and the issue is becoming increasingly polarizing as time goes on.
<p>VOJ: Why not just talk it out and be nice about it?
<p>C: Surprisingly, Gottman suggests avoiding it and treating it like a pesky allergy or a bad back. It won’t go away but you don’t let it overwhelm your life. 
<p>VOJ: But I thought the principle was about overcoming gridlock?
<p>C: If you have to talk about it, then realize gridlock is a sign that you have dreams for your life that the other isn’t aware of, hasn’t acknowledged, or doesn’t respect. They usually come from your childhood. Common ones include a sense of freedom, feeling at peace, or an adventure.
<p>VOJ: So basically a Nike ad.
<p>C: Pretty close. Alright, the seventh and last principle is to create shared meaning. It’s about creating your own marriage microculture. You do this through customs (like Sunday dinner out), rituals (like a champagne toast after the birth of each baby), and myths — the stories the couple tell themselves that explain their sense of what their marriage is like and what it means to be part of their group.
<p>VOJ: Like creating your own cult. That sounds like a lot.
<p>C: Actually it only takes an extra six hours a week. 
<p>VOJ: Huh, that’s not so bad.
<p>C: Right. So time to get swiping on Tinder.
<p>VOJ: Alright, another story to finish!
A newly wed couple were talking about children. The bride said she wanted three, while the husband wanted two. They talked about the difference for a few minutes until the husband thought he'd put an end to things by saying boldly, "After our second child, I'll just have a vasectomy."
The bride replied, "Well, I hope you'll love the third one like it's your own!"
