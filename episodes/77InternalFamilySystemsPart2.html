              <h1>#77. Internal Family Systems Part 2.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter two focuses on the idea of your true self and how the last place
                  we look for peace and joy is inside ourselves.
                  <p>Voice OF Judgement: It sounds very new age-y. For five thousand dollars, we’ll help you find the real you!
                  <p>C: For the author, it’s about having the parts of yourself all get along or to get to a place of “no parts”. 
                  <p>VOJ: Wait. Have “no parts” but have them all get along?
                  <p>C: Another way to look at it is like when you’re in the zone or a flow state. The internal voices are quiet.
                  <p>VOJ: And how do you get there?
                  <p>C: Through your anger, damage and grief.
                  <p>VOJ: Oof! No thanks! I’ll pass on finding peace and joy. 
                  <p>C: Ah, but when you go through it, it’s like you’re one with the universe and have this spaciousness in the body and mind. 
                  <p>VOJ: Meh, I’m not quite sold.
                  <p>C: Here’s a quick anecdote that might help:
                  A man whose axe was missing suspected his neighbor’s
                  son. The boy walked like a thief, looked like a thief, and
                  spoke like a thief. Soon the man found his axe while he
                  was digging in the valley, and the next time he saw his
                  neighbor’s son, the boy walked, looked, and spoke like any
                  other child. 
                  <p>VOJ: Sooo, don’t lose your axe.
                  <p>C: The point is that when you’re not at peace with yourself, you’re not at peace with the world.
                  <p>VOJ: So just go sit and quiet the mind.
                  <p>C: Depends on how you quiet the mind. If you do it by ignoring the hurt parts, then they tend to scream louder. But if you’re willing to go in to your closets, look around, and make friends with what’s there, you might another part of yourself that you can call home.
                  <p>VOJ: That’s very poetic.
                  <p>C: Well, we’re stealing it from the author, who’s stealing it from Anne Lamott.
                  <p>VOJ: But we’re all connected so it’s a-okay.
                  <p>C: Right. To close out, here’s an exercise from the chapter:
                  Think of a person in your life to whom you have closed your heart. Once you have a person
                  in mind, imagine that person is in a room and you are outside the
                  room looking in at the person through a window. Notice how you
                  feel as you look at that person. You might feel angry, detached,
                  afraid, or judgmental. Now shift your focus to that feeling and ask if it would be willing to separate from you a little bit, just for a few moments, while you remain outside the room.
                  <p>VOJ: Then what?
                  <p>C: That’s it. It’s just about noticing a part of yourself you don’t normally bring awareness to.
                  <p>VOJ: So what you’re saying is that I should listen to the voices in my head.
                  <p>C: Uhh, maybe?
                  <p>VOJ: Last week, I went to the doctor because I kept hearing nonstop voices. Apparently they’re called children.
                  <p>C: We don’t have any children.
                  <p>VOJ: And that’s why you should be worried.
