              <h1>#32. The Truth (Part 1).</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today’s book has sex, trauma and addiction in it. So maybe don’t listen to this around kids?  The book is called “The Truth” and is by Neil Strauss.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Didn’t he write “The Game”?
<p>C: Yes.
<p>VOJ: Guess he like his two word titles.
<p>C: Yes again. The Game is about picking up women. The Truth is about relationships. 
<p>VOJ: Makes sense. Meet women. Keep women.
<p>C: Except, in this book, he learns that he’s not so great at relationships.
<p>VOJ: How’s that?
<p>C: Well, the book starts off with him going to rehab for his sex addiction. He recognizes he’s got a problem when he cheats on his girlfriend that he’s committed to.
<p>VOJ: Yeah, that’s not going to be great for the relationship. 
<p>C: The good news is that while in rehab, he learns a lot about how the addiction came about and how it affects the relationships in his life.
<p>VOJ: How did his addiction come about?
<p>C: His mother was strict and punishing. His father was distant and unemotional. To try to heal that pain, he used sex to find the affection, acceptance, and comfort he never got. 
<p>VOJ: But wasn’t he getting that from his girlfriend?
<p>C: The trouble was that monogamy felt too controlling like his relationship with his mother. Cheating was his way of regaining control and sense of self.  
<p>VOJ: So how does rehab help with that?
<p>C: It’s a lot like Kolk’s book, “The Body Keeps The Score”, that talked about healing from trauma. In group therapy, you share your timeline of childhood memories that had a strong impact or imprint. There’s also regular check ins through out the day, naming one of the eight basic emotions.
<p>VOJ: What are those?
<p>C: Anger, Fear, Pain, Joy, Passion, Love, Shame, and Guilt. That’s according to Pia Mellody.
<p>VOJ: Who’s that?
<p>C: She’s one of the many experts that the author draws from. Mellody wrote several books on intimacy, codependence, and love addiction. 
<p>VOJ: Oh my god, so many words. Why so many words?
<p>C: Okay, let me break them down. The book’s intimacy definition is “as into me that I see and sharing that with you”. Codependence and love addiction are defined similarly as needing some body else. 
<p>VOJ: I thought the author was a sex addict. He’s also a love addict?
<p>C: No, he’s a love avoidant, also known as counter dependent. Which means he fears intimacy. Love addicts, on the other hand, fear abandonment.
<p>VOJ: I’m so confused.
<p>C: Here’s another way to look at it. Love avoidants fear being with others. Love addicts fear being with themselves. 
<p>VOJ: So how do you get over that fear?
<p>C: During rehab, the author goes through this intense and accelerated technique called post-induction therapy or chair work. He’s put in to a trance and has these imagined emotional conversations with those who caused him trauma. 
<p>VOJ: How does that help?
<p>C: It’s a way to re-parent your inner child.
<p>VOJ: Kind of like how we’re talking to our selves!
<p>C: Exactly. This book covers a lot, so we’ll break it in to parts and stop for today. Here’s the closing quote:
<p>“A healthy relationship is when two individuated adults decide to have a relationship and that becomes a third entity. They nurture the relationship and the relationship nurtures them. But they’re not overly dependent or independent: They are interdependent, which means that they take care of the majority of their needs and wants on their own, but when they can’t, they’re not afraid to ask their partner for help…. Only when our love for someone exceeds our need for them do we have a shot at a genuine relationship together.”
