							 <p>Chris: Chapter 9 answers the question - “Can people really change?”
<p>Other Voice: Well, a leopard can’t change its spots.
<p>C: It might depend on the right conditions. If the leopard’s dissatisfaction, vision, and first steps are greater than its resistance then its spots might change. Dissatisfaction is awareness of the cost of your present behavior, vision is the benefit of the new behavior and the first steps are the new skills needed to make the change easier.
<p>OV: What if a leopard is just the way it is?
<p>C: When you conclude too quickly that a certain set of behaviors is
“the way that person is and will always be,” you might be doing them
an injustice. Instead, try to understand all the factors that perpetuate
that pattern of behavior. No one’s born with genes for being inconsiderate or self-centered.
<p>OV: What if someone wants me to change but I’m not doing anything wrong?
<p>C: There’s a difference between feeling defensive and having to defend oneself. If somebody makes an inaccurate accusation or misunderstands you or attacks you then it’s appropriate to defend yourself.
<p>OV: How do you know the difference?
<p>C: You’ll probably be feeling defensive regardless if your behavior is right or wrong. Acknowledge the feeling, and hold back your tendency to rebut.
Instead, try to understand what the other is saying. Set aside the need to “be right.”
<p>OV: What if I’m still not doing anything wrong?
<p>C: It’s quite possible. You might not need to change your behavior but you can still emotionally meet the other person. You can actively listen, paraphrase and acknowledge feelings, convey care, suspend judgment, ask open-ended questions, and try to understand what is going on for the other person.  
<p>OV: Aren’t you just avoiding the issue then? 
<p>C: Sometimes it’s less about the issue and more about understanding the other person. A deeper issue may even come up. Resolving that deeper issue will help not only with the issue at hand but also with future problem-solving, resulting in a far deeper and more robust relationship.
<p>OV: Reminds me of the scorpion and the frog. The scorpion wants to cross a river but can’t swim, so it asks the frog to carry it across. The frog isn’t sure and asks, “How do I know you’re not going to sting me?” The scorpion replies, “I promise I won’t. If I sting you, then we’ll both drown.” That makes sense to the frog so it agrees. Halfway across the river, the scorpion stings the frog anyway and they start drowning. The dying frog yells, “Why did you do that?” The scorpion replies, “I can’t help it. I’m a scorpion.”
<p>C: Leopards, scorpions, and frogs. The point seems to be animals don’t change. 
<p>OV: Well, we don’t seem to change our behavior of doing too many lists on this podcast. 
<p>C: Yeah, I’m not sure the best way around it. Who knew being human is about remembering lists.
<p>OV: Our future wife probably.
<p>C: I sure hope she doesn’t listen to this.
