              <h1>#53. The Art Of Possibility Part 10.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The eleventh practice is creating frameworks for possibility. An example is a teacher who shaves her head when one of her students loses their hair because of chemotherapy. The teacher is reframing the child’s sudden change in appearance as the norm. The rest of her students treated it like a game, shaved their heads too and nobody felt left out.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: It’s good thing we’re already bald. We don’t get left out either. We always look like we have cancer.
<p>C: Ummm, nurses might find that attractive? Anyway, here’s a story from Benjamin about creating a new framework:
<p>On our 1997 tour to Brazil, the New England Conservatory
Youth Philharmonic gave its first big public concert in the Teatro
Municipal in São Paolo after three exhausting days of rehearsing,
sightseeing, and touring. The house was filled to capacity. The
enthusiasm of the warm-hearted, passionate Brazilian audience was
overwhelming. Brazilian national television filmed the event and,
afterward, projected it on a ten-foot screen in the foyer so the kids
could see themselves. They were high as kites. Now the problem
was to calm them so they could get to sleep and be fresh for the
concert the following day. It was after midnight when we returned to
the hotel.
<p>The next morning I received an angry note from a guest saying
he had been woken by a group of noisy musicians. Several other
guests had been disturbed as well, the hotel staff informed us. Four
students were found on the roof after 3 A.M., and four others were
picked up in an unsavory part of town in the early hours of the
morning by the security squad of our sponsor, BankBoston.
<p>The next day, the orchestra was to play not one but two concerts,
an outdoor event at 6 P.M. in front of fifteen thousand people, and an
indoor performance at 9 P.M. of Mahler’s technically and emotionally
draining Fifth Symphony. The chaperones swung into action and
demanded that I read the students the riot act. They wanted me to
remind the kids that they had signed a contract prior to setting out on
the tour forbidding them to consume alcohol or break curfew.
<p>Roz and I consulted on the telephone, from Brazil to Boston, and
addressed the problem, as we always do, with the question, “What
distinction shall we make here that will bring possibility to the
situation?” A broken contract points to the dualism of good and bad,
and leads into the downward spiral, so we looked for another
framework in which to consider the young people’s behavior. I
realized that while the rules for the tour had been carefully set up in
contract form, I had never formally discussed with the kids their
purpose for being in Brazil, beyond giving concerts. Purpose,
commitment, and vision are distinctions that radiate possibility. We
decided that I should hold a conversation about vision with the
group, as a framework for addressing the late-night events.
<p>Summoned to the auditorium, the diffident young players sat as
far back as possible, their teenage bodies in various postures of
exhaustion and protest. Every face, innocent or malfeasant, reflected
that they were about to receive a well-deserved dressing down. “Last
night after the concert,” I began, “a woman came to me and told me
with absolute honesty that the two hours she spent listening to
Mahler’s Fifth Symphony had been the most beautiful two hours of
her entire life. You gave a great performance last night, and she was
not the only one moved and changed by it.” Their faces looked blank
for a moment, as though they could not hear these words that were
so unexpected. After a pause, I went on, “What else did you come
here to offer the Brazilian people?”
<p>One by one, from various parts of the hall, came answers to the
question: We came to show them the best of America! That great
music is a way of communicating friendship and love. We came to
show respect for Brazil! That teenagers can make great music! That
music can be fun! That we are happy to be here! By now the
answers were coming from all corners, and the faces were lit up with
joy.
<p>When exuberance and ease were palpable throughout the room,
I said, “Of course, if you’d given a terrible concert last night, you
probably would have all come home and gone straight to bed. It was
precisely your exhilaration at having participated with so many
people in great music-making that resulted in four kids being on the
roof. It’s just surprising that they didn’t float any higher on sheer
energy! But does waking the hotel guests at night represent the gift
we wanted to bring the Brazilian people? Obviously not. We got off
track. You have to know where the track is to get back on, and
you’ve all just expressed that beautifully.”
<p>Two of the kids volunteered to write letters of apology to those
who had been disturbed at the hotel, and others thought of additional
ways to brighten our image with the people of São Paolo. No one felt
blamed or made wrong. We left the auditorium with everyone in high
spirits, ready to give two invigorating concerts.
<p>Just as I was leaving the hall, one of the chaperones said, “But
you didn’t punish anybody!” And then he added as an afterthought,
“Though, I don’t suppose they would be in the mood to give another
great Mahler performance if you had, and, really, I don’t think we will
have to worry about them again.”
<p>VOJ: So people should never be punished?
<p>C: I don’t know. But the point is that when people aren’t living up to their higher calling, it leads to poor behavior. The art of possibility is about raising the spirits of yourself and others. There’s a movie scene in “The Shawshank Redemption” that demonstrates this. A prison inmate, Andy Dufresne, at the risk of breaking all the rules, decides to play opera on the prison’s announcement system. Here’s a clip describing the effects of that: [Sound clip from the movie "Shawshank Redemption"]
