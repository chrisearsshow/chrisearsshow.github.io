              <h1>#60. Making Marriage Work Part 6.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The fifth principle is solving your solvable problems.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Ugh. This principle has so many steps.
<p>C: Yeah, it’s quite the recipe. I imagine it’ll take a couple a bit of practice to get down. The first step is to soften your start-up. We covered this in a previous episode. Basically don’t start with criticism or intense negative emotion.
<p>VOJ: Got it. Step one. Be nice.
<p>C: Step two is to make and receive repair attempts. Repair attempts are about finding common ground emotionally. 
<p>VOJ: Okay. Step two. Keep being nice.
<p>C: Right. Step three is soothe yourself and each other.
<p>VOJ: Are all the steps about being nice?
<p>C: Yeah, pretty much. Step four is compromise. Step five is process any grievances so that they don’t linger.
<p>VOJ: How are you supposed to process grievances? 
<p>C: He breaks step five in to even more steps which we won’t get in to. Basically it’s a multi-step process similar to conflict resolution.
<p>VOJ: This book makes me not want to get married. 
<p>C: Yeah, it’s sounding like a lot of work.
<p>VOJ: Okay, story time:
A husband and wife had been married for 60 years and had no secrets except for one: The woman kept in her closet a shoe box that she forbade her husband from ever opening. But when she was on her deathbed—and with her blessing—he opened the box and found a crocheted doll and $95,000 in cash. “My mother told me that the secret to a happy marriage was to never argue,” she explained. “Instead, I should keep quiet and crochet a doll.” Her husband was touched. Only one doll was in the box—that meant she’d been angry with him only once in 60 years. “But what about all this money?” he asked. “Oh,” she said, “that’s the money I made from selling the dolls.”
