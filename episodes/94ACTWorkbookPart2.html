              <h1>#94. ACT Workbook Part 2.</h1>
							  <p>Man, this episode has been hard to write but let’s get through it.
                <p>Chapter 3 talks about Defectiveness Coping Behaviors, which are grouped into three major types: overcompensation, surrender, and avoidance. An example of overcompensation is dominance and trying to control others. An example of surrender is dependence and people-pleasing. And an example of avoidance is social withdrawal or excessive autonomy. Most of my coping behaviors fall under the avoidance category. 
                <p>The chapter goes into a worksheet that looks at what triggers the coping behaviors. Since friendship is a domain that I find lacking in my life, I decided to look at that. An example situation is when I’m not being heard or understood. This leads to thoughts that this friendship lacks mutuality and isn’t safe. Which leads to primary emotions of inadequacy and anger. This then leads to the urge and behavior to hide away from the world and avoid socializing. The final consequence is that my circle of friends grows smaller and smaller. Man, that’s so crazy that just from that one thing of not being heard and understood, it escalates to isolation. 
                <p>Thinking about friendships this week has been hard and it’s been interesting watching my mind come up with excuses to not make new friends. The protective voice says that I need to be working instead of socializing or that friendships never last or that people will never understand me. I spiral pretty quick which is why this episode was so hard to write.
                <p>This brings us nicely to Chapter 4, which talks about how coping behaviors seem to make things better but actually make things worse. My aloneness and social withdrawal only reinforce the defectiveness schema. So instead of trying to get away from my pain and emotions, what happens when I turn towards it, observe it, and allow it to be what it is?
                <p>Then the chapter goes into alternative responses to my triggers. So when I’m not being heard, instead of withdrawing, I can ask the other person for what I need. Or I can pay attention to the friends I’m choosing to share with and whether they’re good listeners. I can also cast a wider net of friends so that I have more options.
                <p>The last couple of episodes have been a bit lacking in the comedy factor but hopefully, personal pain is just as entertaining? Here’s a joke anyway to lighten things up: A man didn't come home one night. The next day he told his wife that he had slept over at a buddy's house. The woman called her husband's ten best friends. Eight of them confirmed that he had slept over, and two claimed that he was still there.
                <p>I hope this was an act of love. Thank you for listening.
