              <h1>#42. Mating In Captivity Part 3.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Alright, this is the last part of the book, “Mating in Captivity” by Esther Perel. 
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Finally! We’ve been spending forever on this book!
<p>C: Yeah, so let’s speed through it. If you haven’t listened to the first parts, this book is about rediscovering sex while being married. Chapter 8 is about neglecting your sexual needs when you become a parent.
<p>VOJ: How do you fix that?
<p>C: What happens is that the primary caretaker gets totally immersed in the children and loses themself. The more autonomous parent can help by encouraging disengagement from the children and creating an atmosphere where desire can develop. The primary caretaker can also learn to integrate sexuality and parenthood.
<p>VOJ: That sounds creepy.
<p>C: Not at the same time, you dingbat!
<p>VOJ: Oh, okay. 
<p>C: Chapter 9 is about how fantasies don’t need to become a reality but can be a useful insight into deeper needs and solutions. You don’t have to reveal them to your partner but processing them with a therapist can be helpful. If you do reveal them to a partner, they need to be able to create an accepting and compassionate space for it.
<p>VOJ: Cool.
<p>C: Chapter 10 brings in to question sexual exclusivity. It usually comes from wanting the primordial oneness we felt with Mom. But recognizing the third, can reinvigorate a couple’s sexuality, and remind them that we do not own our partners. 
<p>VOJ: What’s the third? 
<p>C: People outside the couple. So like flirting, swinging or an open marriage.
<p>VOJ: Wow, that escalated quickly!
<p>C: We don’t have time! Chapter 11 is about how married sex has too much baggage with it. Not all sex has to be love making. It can be playful sex and angry sex, quick, “mindless” sex and “naughty” sex.
<p>VOJ: You just said sex six times.
<p>C: Thank you for counting. Here’s the closing quote, 
<p>“Complaining of sexual
boredom is easy and conventional. Nurturing eroticism in the home
is an act of open defiance.”
<p>VOJ: Hey, I didn’t get to say anything. 
<p>C: Okay, now is your chance.
<p>VOJ: Anything!
