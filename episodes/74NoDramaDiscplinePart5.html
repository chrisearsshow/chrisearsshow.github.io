              <h1>#74. No Drama Discipline Part 5.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 5 is about the 1-2-3 approach - one definition, two principles, and three desired outcomes.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: It’s like we’re doing Sesame Street now. 
                <p>C: It’s a simple way to remember everything the book has covered so far. The one definition is to remember that discipline is about teaching.
                <p>VOJ: Not punching. Got it.
                <p>C: The two principles are:
                <ol>
                <li> Wait until your child is ready.
                <li> Be consistent, but not rigid.
                </ol> 
                The first principle is about finding the sweet spot of engagement. You don’t want the person to be underaroused and bored, and you don’t want them overaroused and hyperactive.
                <p>VOJ: So make them zen.
                <p>C: Right. And also be zen yourself. The second principle is about knowing the difference between consistency and rigidity. Start by knowing what is non-negotiable, like physical safety. When you know that, then you know where you can make exceptions to other boundaries and allow more factors to come in to play.
                <p>VOJ: Okay, keep the kid alive. And then be nice.
                <p>C: Close enough. And the three mindsight outcomes are:
                <ol>
                <li> Insight
                <li> Empathy
                <li> Integration and the repair of ruptures
                </ol>
                <p>VOJ: Man, these guys like lists.
                <p>C: Those outcomes are pretty self explanatory so we won’t go over them again.
                <p>VOJ: You know, I was reading another list. It was called “100 Things To Do Before You Die”. Surprisingly, “yell for help” wasn’t one of them.
                <p>C: Oh man, that’s terrible.
                <p>VOJ: Here’s another.
                A bear walks into a bar and says, “Give me a whiskey and … coke.” 
                “Why the big pause?” asks the bartender. 
                The bear shrugged. “I’m not sure; I was born with them.”
                <p>C: I feel like we’re going to get canceled.
