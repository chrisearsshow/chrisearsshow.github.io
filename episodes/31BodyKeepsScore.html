              <h1>#31. The Body Keeps The Score.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Today’s book is by Bessel van der Kolk and is titled the Body Keeps Score.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: 15 - 30.
<p>C: What’s that?
<p>VOJ: I’m just keeping score.
<p>C: Right. So this book is about trauma so if you’re having a rough day, you might want to pass on this episode.
<p>VOJ: I thought this was a comedy podcast.
<p>C: I did too. The book title sounded harmless and came highly recommended.
<p>VOJ: By who?
<p>C: Amazon.
<p>VOJ: Can’t ever trust those computers.
<p>C: Yeah, it’s been a rough week reading this book.
<p>VOJ: Yeah, you could almost say it was traumatic. 
<p>C: Here’s where Kolk’s definition of trauma might be helpful - “Trauma is not the story of something that happened back then. It's the current imprint of that pain, horror, and fear living inside people.”
<p>VOJ: Isn’t that everybody? 
<p>C: Pretty much. The book starts off with some pretty scary statistics.
<p>VOJ: Dare I ask?
<p>C: CDC research has shown that one in five Americans was sexually molested as a child; one in four was beaten by a parent to the point of a mark being left on their body; and one in three couples engages in physical violence. A quarter of Americans grew up with alcoholic relatives, and one out of eight witnessed their mother being beaten or hit.
<p>VOJ: That’s a lot of people.
<p>C: Yeah, and it’s not just violence that can lead to trauma. It can also be emotional distance and withdrawal by your caregivers. Our parents are imperfect humans who may suffer from trauma themselves, which means they may not be able to attune to their own emotions and therefore their children. 
<p>VOJ: Okay, so everyone’s broken. How do we fix it?
<p>C: Volk offers several options. EMDR, yoga, community creation, neurofeedback and theater. 
<p>VOJ: That’s a lot of fixes. What’s EMDR?
<p>C: It stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. It’s a type of therapy where painful memories are processed with the help of eye movement.
<p>VOJ: It sounds like dance music for paramedics.
<p>C: It could be that too.
<p>VOJ: And how does yoga and community creation help with trauma?
<p>C: Here’s where the book title comes in. When a traumatic thing happens to us, we’re in a heightened awareness that we can’t escape. This causes a physiological change where are brains and bodies stay over-activated. It’s like non stop fire alarms. 
<p>VOJ: That paramedics can dance to.
<p>C: Sure. To deal with those constant alarms, people numb themselves out to not feel any more and they grow to distrust their bodies and other people.  
<p>VOJ: How do they do that?
<p>C: So many ways. Sugar, alcohol, most digital devices... basically any thing that helps you dissociate and escape from the present moment.
<p>VOJ: So yoga and community creation changes that.
<p>C: Yup. With yoga, you relearn how to trust and be in your body, With community creation, you relearn to trust and be with others. 
<p>VOJ: Okay, so what’s neurofeedback?
<p>C: It’s where they use an EEG to measure your brain waves.
<p>VOJ: Oh, it’s that thing with wires that makes your head look like a sad porcupine.
<p>C: Right. And with a computer, you learn to slow down your brain waves by being calm and focused.
<p>VOJ: There you go again, letting a computer control your thoughts.
<p>C: Pretty much. Most digital devices are about manipulating your thoughts. Neurofeedback is one that hopefully leads to a healthier brain. 
<p>VOJ: Okay, and the last fix is theater. How does that help?
<p>C: That’s about using the arts like acting, dancing and singing to find your voice and expression. It’s a way to re-learn how to exert yourself when trauma took that ability away from you. It also helps you re-find your humanity and to feel deeply.
<p>VOJ: Man, this psych class is heavy.
<p>C: Yeah. On the upside though, it helps you understand that there are a lot of hurt people out there. That they’re most probably acting from a place of hurt and not maliciousness. And that there are many paths to recovery.
<p>VOJ: Alright, I need a Netflix computer to control my brain.
<p>C: Works for me. Here’s the closing quote: 
<p>“Once you start approaching your body with curiosity rather than with fear, everything shifts.”
