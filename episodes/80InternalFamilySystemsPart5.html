              <h1>#80. Internal Family Systems Part 5.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: Chapter 5 is the final chapter and covers what it’s like to go to an Internal Family Systems therapist.
                <p>Voice Of Judgement: Like popcorn and unicorns?
                <p>C: Well, it is if your protective parts can step aside.
                <p>VOJ: Stupid protective parts.
                <p>C: Like we talked about before, there aren’t bad parts. Just good parts in the wrong roles. The idea is to be curious, compassionate towards all your parts.
                <p>VOJ: So what does the therapist do?
                <p>C: The therapist will ask the protective parts to step aside.
                <p>VOJ: That’s it?
                <p>C: Not usually. The protective parts will usually resist and have lots of fears. The therapist will work with those parts to put those fears on the table.
                <p>VOJ: And then get rid of them.
                <p>C: Maybe. Sometimes the fears are legitimate so then it’s about finding a safe solution.
                <p>VOJ: Like the fear that there’s not enough ice cream.
                <p>C: Sure. There could be a major ice cream shortage because the climate makes everything melt. But back to the vulnerable parts and their fears. It’s about witnessing them and the therapist will ask them to show their memories of their past.
                <p>VOJ: Then what?
                <p>C: When the part feels fully witnessed, then the therapist might have you enter the memory and have you retrieve the part from the past. Or they might have you work with the part to unload the beliefs and emotions from the painful experience.
                <p>VOJ: Sounds like normal therapy but with more pieces.
                <p>C: The author acknowledges that it sounds simple but the process isn’t easy.
                <p>VOJ: So how do you know when the therapy is working?
                <p>C: It’s not clear. The author explains that IFS therapy can sometimes feel like you’re going in circles. You think you’re going in one area but end up in another.
                <p>VOJ: Sounds like a good way to keep someone in therapy forever.
                <p>C: It might be helpful to journal or tape record the sessions to help remember what happened. That way you get some indicator of progress. Another suggestion from the author is to plan and be prepared to be more impulsive or withdrawn during the process. 
                <p>VOJ: Sounds fun! That reminds me of a joke. A man was walking in the street one day when he gets robbed and beaten up. As he laid there, unconscious and bleeding, a therapist passes by, rushes up to him and says, "My God! Whoever did this really needs help!"
                <p>C: Great. So you’re making fun of therapists.
                <p>VOJ: Here’s another. A Freudian slip is when you say one thing and mean your mother.
                <p>C: Eventually you’ll run out of these.
                <p>VOJ: A guy is applying for a job as a receptionist. The interviewer goes, "I see you used to be employed by a psychotherapist. Why did you leave?" The guy replies, "Well, I just couldn't win. If I was late to work, I was hostile; if I was early, I was anxious; and if I was on time, I was obsessive."
