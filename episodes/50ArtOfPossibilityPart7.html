              <h1>#50. The Art Of Possibility Part 7.</h1>
							  <p>Chris: The eighth practice is to give way to passion.
<p>Voice Of Judgement: Like French kissing?
<p>C: I think they mean passion for life.
<p>VOJ: Step one. Find a girlfriend.
<p>C: Actually, there are two steps to to this practice. The first is to notice where you are holding back and to let go of what’s keeping you separate and in control.
<p>VOJ: What keeps us separate is we don’t have a girlfriend. 
<p>C: Now we sound desperate. The second step is to participate wholly.
<p>VOJ: Tinder! Okcupid! Match.com! All of them!
<p>C: Alright, while you do that, here’s an anecdote from Benjamin Zander about Jacqueline Du Pre:  
<p>I met Jacqueline Du Pre in the 1950s, when I was twenty and she
was fifteen, a gawky English schoolgirl who blossomed into the
greatest cellist of her generation. We played the Two Cello Quintet of
Schubert together, and I remember her playing was like a tidal wave
of intensity and passion. When she was six years old, the story goes,
she went into her first competition as a cellist, and she was seen
running down the corridor carrying her cello above her head, with a
huge grin of excitement on her face. A custodian, noting what he
took to be relief on the little girl’s face, said, “I see you’ve just had
your chance to perform!” And Jackie answered, excitedly, “No, no,
I’m just about to!”
<p>VOJ: Wow, cello really was her passion.
<p>C: Yeah. And here’s another story from Benjamin about another cellist:
<p>A student from Spain, a member of my Wednesday Sonata and
Lieder class at the New England Conservatory, asked me to coach
him in preparation for an audition for the position of associate
principal cellist of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra. He played his
pieces through with elegance and accuracy. It was playing of an
absolutely professional standard, the kind of performance that would,
I told him, gain him entry into the ranks of an orchestra. However, it
lacked flair and the characteristics of true leadership—not only
command of color, intensity, drive, and passion, but the energy to
take people beyond where they would normally go. We started work
on the pieces—I played the piano, sang, coaxed, and urged him on
until his rather formal restraint broke down, and he began to play
from the heart and throw all his passion and energy into the soaring
passages of the Dvorak Concerto. In the middle of one of his most
impassioned utterances, I stopped him and said, “There, that’s it. If
you play that way, they won’t be able to resist you. You will be a
compelling force behind which everyone will be inspired to play their
best.” He wiped the sweat from his brow and from his cello, and we
retired to the kitchen for a spaghetti dinner and a bottle of good red
wine. As he left the house that night, I shouted behind him,
“Remember, Marius, play it the second way!” “I will!” he called back.
<p>Three weeks later he telephoned.
“How did it go, Marius?” I was eager to know.
“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t make it.”
“What happened?” I asked, as I prepared to console him.
He answered matter-of-factly, “I played the first way.”
“Never mind, Marius,” I said. “You will have other chances.” In my
mind I vowed to work with him further on releasing his enormous
capacity for expression. But it turned out that he had discovered how
to break through the gates himself.
“No, no, no,” he said. “You haven’t heard the whole story. I was
so peesed off, I said, ‘Fock it, I’m going to Madrid to play the audition
for the principal cellist in the orchestra there!’—and I won it, at twice
the salary of the other job.”
“What happened?” I asked again, in amazement.
He laughed. “I played the second way!”
<p>VOJ: Huh, maybe we should start playing the cello.
<p>C: Sounds like a plan. To close, here’s a quote from Martha Graham, a dance icon, about giving way to passion:
<p>There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is
translated through you into action, and because there is only one of
you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will
never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world
will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor
how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your
business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel
open.
<p>VOJ: Ding! Hey, we got a match! I wonder if she plays the cello. Time for passion!
